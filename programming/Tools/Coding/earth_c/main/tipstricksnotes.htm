<h3><font color="#000000">Tips&amp;Tricks&amp;various notes</font></h3>
<p><font color="#000000">If you want to create your own scripts you should read
this notes to avoid some surprices, artifacts or game crashes.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li>EarthC and other tools in this package were designed for developer use
    only. It means that these tools are not very error-resistant. For example
    you can write script which is compiled without errors but game will crash
    when this script is used. Before writing your own scripts you should study
    included script sources, and if some bugs in your scripts occurs try to
    compare it with our scripts - some functions must be used in some specific
    order or with other functions.</li>
  <li>Scripts compiled with included EarthC.exe tool are working only with Earth
    2150 version 2.8.7 and can crash while used in older game versions.</li>
  <li>Test your scripts well before you publish them. We are not resposible for
    psychical/physical damages made by your buggy scripts :).</li>
  <li>Don't be surprised if you will see some strange comments in scripts. It's
    Polish. (And BTW sorry for poor and buggy English in this
    documentation)&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Don't copy this documentation to Earth 2150 game
    directory. At startup Earth scans this directory and read headers of all
    files, so doing this operation with large amount of files takes a lot of
    time.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Use WDCreator tool - its comfortable becouse it creates
    one file instead of many files in many directories.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">In multiplayer game all missing files like
    non-standard levels, user banners or scripts (gametypes, AI players, unit
    scripts) are downloaded before game starts (in session configuration
    dialog). If such a file is placed in '*.wd' file then whole '*.wd' file is
    downloaded. So don't make too big '*.wd' files (f.e. don't put 100
    multiplayer levels into single file) becouse it take too much time to
    download it.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">You don't need to copy '*.wd' files to 'WDFiles'
    directory. It's good idea to copy this files to f.e. 'CustomWDFiles'
    directory.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">If you will modify some standard Earth files (like
    levels or scripts) save it under other name (otherwise it will cover
    standard file from '*.wd' file).</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Many EarthC functions uses values called
    &quot;tick&quot;. Tick is one game simulation step. For default game speed
    game makes 20 ticks per second (5 for minimum, 50 for maximum game
    speed).&nbsp; But if game have a lot to calculate and a lot to display (f.e.
    battle displayed in maximum zoom out) than (especially at maximum game
    speed) game can slow down and make leess ticks per second than it should do.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">File names for mission levels should start with char
    '!' (f.e. !234.lnd, !234.mis). Such a files are not displayed in
    skirmish/multiplayer configuration dialog. To load such a file in editor
    (which normally don't display files begining with '!') use console command
    'editor.singleplayer 1' (in editor press Enter, type: editor.singleplayer 1
    and press Enter again). If you are bored doing it all the time you can put
    this line in file 'autoexec.con' in main Earth 2150 directory. Using
    'editor.singleplayer' command you can open all levels from standard Earth
    campaigns.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Use LangC and &quot;translate*&quot; strings in
    scripts instead of putting plain text. It looks much better, don't cost a
    lot of time and your scripts can be easy translated to other language.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Scripts of all types are stored in saves, and when
    save is loaded game uses scripts stored in save file. So if you want for
    example to test changed mission script you must start this mission again (choose it in
    choose mission dialog). If you have changed campaign script you must start
    the whole campaign again.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">You can debug your scripts. To do that use script
    function TraceD with parameter string or number. To see this traces you must
    turn on display with console command: 'display.show 1'.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">Game type scripts (for skirmish and multiplayer),
    are stored in two directories. Scripts for multiplayer games are stored in
    'Scripts\Gametypes' directory and scripts for skirmish are stored in
    'Scripts\Gametypes\single' directory.</font></li>
  <li><font color="#000000">In unit and mission scripts delete any reference
    members (of type unit, tank, etc) in command Uninitialize. It's very
    important, otherwise game can crash after exiting campaign mission.)</font></li>
  <li>
Your campaign script name must begin with CampaignED (CampaignUCS, CampaignLC or
    TutorialED, TutorialUCS, TutorialLC for tutorial campaigns)&nbsp; f.e.: CampaignEDSomeExtension.eco
    (or TutorialEDSomeExt.eco for tutorial) and must
be placed in directory Scripts\Campaigns\ED (or UCS, LC for other races). If
your campaign name (in first line of script) have name f.e. &quot;translateCampaignEDMySuperCamp&quot;
then you can add string with &quot;Description&quot; suffix (&quot;translateCampaignEDMySuperCampDescription&quot;) -
with short description of your campaign. This string will be displayed in the text
box in 'Choose campaign' dialog.</li>
  <li>If you have added some custom campaign (or tutorial) you should see
    'Choose campaign' dialog after pressing 'Start new game' or 'Tutorial'
    button. If this dialog is not displayed (and game start immediately) it
    means that your campaign script have bad file name, or is placed in bad
    directory.</li>
  <li>If you are testing your campaign you can use console command
    'ai.allmissions 1' - then you can select any mission in 'Choose mission'
    dialog.</li>
  <li>In any campaign mission you can use console command 'world.endmission 1' -
    then button 'End mission' appears immediatelly.</li>
  <li>You can switch to any AI player in game to see if it works properly and as
    you expect it to work. To do this type console command 'ai.local n' where n
    is an 'IFF number' (slot in which player is placed - numbered from 0 to 15).
    In this case you must first enable cheats with command 'I_wanna_cheat'. Note
    that you will play as AI player but AI in this player is still functioning
    and doing its job.</li>
  <li>Note that you can't add any custom levels or scripts to Demo version of
    Earth 2150.</li>
