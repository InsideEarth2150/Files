With the console command "Editor.LoadBmp filename.bmp"
it is possible to import BMP images as a height map.

However, the picture must meet some requirements:


    72 dpi resolution

    256 grayscale (8 bit)

    Size: Extra large: 256 * 256 pixels, large: 192 * 256
    Pixel, small: 92 * 92


Warning: the accessible area is slightly smaller than that
Map!

You can use all the effects and aids that you have
Photoshop offers. Guides are particularly useful, and the ability to
To mirror things. When mirroring, you have to use layers
copy, mirror and then reassemble the layers). The brighter
the pixel is, the higher the corresponding point is later on the map.
To produce staircases, you can do this very easily with the gradient tool
or the blur filter. Just do the area where there is a staircase
should select, then either draw a gradient or the Gaussian
Apply blur.

Having the basics of the card so very simple
and done quickly, you save the image as a bitmap (BMP) in the TMP main folder.
Then you start TMP and go to the editor. Here you open a new one
Card with the dimension that corresponds to the size of the image. Now press
to hit the enter key and type "Editor.LoadBmp filename.bmp"
on. The editor should now load the heights from the image. Attention: with one
successful loading of the image, the console remains "open" i.e. you
could enter further commands (this can be recognized by a flashing line
bottom left, top of the minimap). You can close this again with Escape.
Now you can add textures, raw materials, starting points and other details.

Mapping with an image editing program is natural
also possible with programs other than Photoshop, it just has to be considered
that the image is saved as an 8-bit grayscale BMP.
