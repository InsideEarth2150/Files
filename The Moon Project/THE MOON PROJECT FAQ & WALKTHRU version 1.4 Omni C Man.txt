S T O R Y  L I N E 

This is the sequel to Earth 2150 so the main story that's more in 
depth is there.

Three groups fight for survival and existence.  Eurasian Dynasty 
(ED) which had setup in Asia and later conquered Europe who has 
an eye on taking back the Americas on Earth.  United Civilized 
States (UCS) who have been attacked over and over and also kept 
an eye on the Lunar Corporation and trying to sabotage their 
secret project.  And the Lunar Corporation (LC) a group who left 
Earth to be on its own and later grew on the Moon to later be the 
most advance of every group there is. They found evidence of an 
existing Extraterrestrial fighting a war in the vicinity of 
Earth, Mars, and all the other planets there. So they then 
started a project to create a warcraft able to sustain life to 
search space to find out more on the extraterrestrial. This 
project is called...
                                ...the Sunlight Project.

Place yourself in one of these groups and fight for their 
purpose.

Units
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><
E U R A S I A N  D Y N A S T Y
ED's units are really primative but when put with the right fire 
powers you can do some good. These people have the almighty and 
mass destruction NUCLEAR BOMB!!!!!! ;)


G R O U N D  T R O O P S
Gruz - Slow and not a fighting unit. This big guy builds the ED's 
buildings and digs in the tunnels. Give major coverage outside of 
base. Always have more than one on the spot to keep a good quick 
pace of base production going on.

Kruszchev - Don't listen to others who say this guy is not good 
for action. He is suited for defending yes but he packs a good 
punch too and not to shabby armor either. Weapon systems are bad 
at all.

Ural - Any called for an exterminator! Yep this guy is your main 
guy for actian. Back him up with the Caspian and Kruszchev for 
superior battle. He may be slow but his armor more than makes up 
for it. Never leave him behind or you won't win without a major 
army in those big fights. But drawback... they are to expensive but 
hey 5-10 is all you need for a for sure victory or atleast major 
killing spree.

Minelayer - Without one your units are good as gone with good 
enemies. This guy will take out and place mines in the fields. 
Never leave home without one.

Caspian - Not the best armor but better than expected and light 
weaponry. Speedy little fellar huh? Heh heh. You can also add on 
to its weaponry with more weapon systems and... its amphibious so 
its never stopped.

Pamir - The equivalent to the UCS Tiger. This is only good in the 
first missions and as a defender.  Also a scout but that's pretty 
much it.

Taiga - It's the money maker right here. This guy will take the 
mined ore to the refinery for some cash. Also the biggest weapons 
and camoflouge systems are good for this guy. But slow so keep it 
covered.

Siberia - The better Taiga except this CAN'T mine. Its faster (to 
an extent), better armor, and morebetter  everything I guess.

N A V A L  U N I T S
Kiev - Your minisub basically. Light armor  and shoots missiles. 
Also its very stealthy.

Leviathan - Your main man for the sea. Long distance and good 
armor but...there is always a but...its slow. But it has on board 
heavy cannons. Have him always during your big sea battles.

Oka - Your sea scout basically. That is all. Very light weapons 
and armor.

Volga - This is a either/or thing. Its sea yet its tank. Slow on 
land and slower over water but rocket launchers can be fitted on 
this big puppy. Also good armor so this is your alternative to 
the Ural and/or Leviathan.

A I R  U N I T S
Transporter - Heavy armor and fast too. Pretty much just used for 
transporting, heh heh go figure.

Cossack - Speedy little devil. Used for scouting and the smallest 
of battles. Light armor too.

Gronzy - It's a Better Cossack. But slower due to better armor. 
Needs support though.

Han - Your bomber. Also transports ore containers. Very fast and 
good armor.

Thor - It can transport things still but only to a limit. But it 
can take the hts and dish it back out.


United Civilized States
Now we get advanced. It has robots for fighting. UCS doesn't have 
major disadvantages but you know there is always a spot but its 
never major. If you fight against them be aware they can put a 
good fight later in the game.

G R O U N D  T R O O P S
Cargo Salamander - It transports you raw materials and good 
weapon system. But don't use as a main fighter since its 
slow...extremely slow. Always upgrade because later rockets can be 
place on this fellar.

Jaguar - Its your alternative to the Panther. More expensive but 
good weaponry and armor. Slow but hey it packs a big punch.

Mammoth - Your building builder. So keep him covered. Plus it 
digs in the tunnels.

Minelayer - It lays the mines and destroys them. Keep this guy 
protected and always have one on the spot.

Ore Harvester - In the name. It harvest ore. Also keep protected.  
On the bright side...it has a flying version comes later.

Panther - Your main fighting unit. Has great armor and good 
weapon systems. It's slow however so go slow with this guy.  In 
packs they pack the biggest punch.

Spider - Pretty quick and good armor and it can take big guns 
(well almost big). It's very maneuverable. 

Tiger - Not the best but better than ED's Pamir. Use this guy to 
scout and small battles. Keep an eye on him when against the LC 
especially due to LC are Tiger killers.


N A V A L  U N I T S
Barracuda Submarine - Very high tech and good in battles. To bad 
you barely get to use him in missions.

Hydra - The power unit of UCS in the sea. Give backup though 
since he is slow.

Shark - The sea scout for UCS.  Light armor but good back up guy 
for helping the Hydra.


A I R  U N I T S
Bat - Slow and better than Gargoyle but light armor so only use 
in small fights.

Condor - Its your supplier. Very speedy but light armor. He gives 
ammo to your guys in battle. Watch him though.

Dragon - Packs a big punch from the sky so he is your person to 
look to for a big air support. Bat is the smaller equivalent to 
this guy so use the Bat when strapped on cash.

Fox Unit Transporter - Used to transport (duh!). Only taken out 
by REAL hits.

Gargoyle - One of the fastest in the game... meaning only use as 
scout and taking out bombers. Only use also in extremely small 
fights.


L U N A R  C O R P O R A T I O N
All around favored for its advance weapons. Only thing is these 
people have NO SEA UNITS.  But other units make up for it.

G R O U N D  U N I T S
Crater - Fastest LC vehicle and comes with shield generator. Also 
has armor so this guy is a good support unit.

Crusher - As fast as the Fat Girls but can carry heavier weapons.  
Starting to be my favorite.

Fat Girl - My extreme favorite unit. It has not 1, not 2, but 4 
WEAPON SYSTEMS!!! Meaning it is the mother of all units. Who 
cares if it is slow it packs the grand punch. Also good at 
defending but to me... made to last and fight. But never leave 
alone because she is strong but speedy guys can make waste in 
time.

Lunar - The scout. Light armor and weapons so you know use as 
defender.

Moon - Fast as Lunar and has good armor meaning support unit for 
Fat Girl.

New Hope - It has its own repair systems but low armor and only 
has one weapon system. But it's fast. Also a unit to support Fat 
Girl or hit and runs.

Tunnel Digger - Basically...digs in the tunnels (duh!). But keep 
guarded. Since they can't defend themselves and their shields 
(once they get some) won't keep them alive long enough.


A I R  U N I T S
Meteor - The air scout. Use when Lunar can't get those hard to 
reach areas.

Super Fighter - Your mix breed of a Meteor and Thunderer. It 
pretty much all around everything so it's good for fighting and 
scouting.

Thunderer - Packs a punch from the sky and it's fast. Though its 
costly but eh.

Transporter - It's in the name. It transports.

Crion - A secret weapon of the LC equipped with a powerful 
Weapon but do not leave it alone.



B U I L D I N G S
Alas...the buildings. Each faction has a different way of 
buildings. I will say when I get to them.

E U R A S I A N  D Y N A S T Y
Artillery - Long rang stationary shooter. Use in to clear a path.
Headquarters - YOU NEED IT!! No matter what happens you MUST 
protect this or everything will be in disarray.

Heavy Tower - Better than Small Towers and Large Towers. Allows 
more weapons to be mounted than other buildings.

Landing Zone - ALWAYS make sure this survives. If this is gone 
you will have a MAJOR problem on getting units to and from your 
main base.

Large Tower - Able to shoot over the Small Tower and the Pill-Box 
which than makes it able to have support from them and has heavy 
defenses.

Mine - This collects the raw material and packages them and Taiga 
tanks will be able to pick them up.

Missile Control Center - This is needed to launch the Atomic 
Warhead Rocket. Leave space around it for the silos though. Also 
protect with great amounts.

Pill-Box - Creates a good stationary defense and has strong 
defense. It can hold units inside too.

Power Plant - Yes every building must be in range of this 
building to even function.

Radar - This shows hidden units and disrupts enemy lines.

Recycler - Pretty much gives you half the money back of any unit 
you put inside. I usually ignore this building since every unit 
can just be upgraded and repaired (depending on whats the cause).

Refinery - Deliver the Ore Containers here and rake in the cash.

Research Center - In the name. Research things here.

Shipyard - Builds your sea units.

Silos - This stores your ballistic and atomic missiles.

Small Tower - It can guard against air units but it isn't so hot 
versus ground units or platoons of them. Only use in the 
beginning after something else is able to be built rebuild to 
that.

Supply Depot - Your supply helicopters go here to get the ammo 
and deliver to your units. Must have for all units that have 
weapons based on energy like lasers or sonic cannon etc.

Tunnel Entrance - If you can't see it...adjust your screen!!! Its 
huge and leads your units underground. Protect with everything 
you can and leave one Gruz unit in the tunnel to make a new 
entrance/exit just in case it is destroyed.

Vehicle Production Center - All civilian units are built here and 
the building can fend for itself slightly.

Weapons Production Center - All fighting units are built here and 
the building can fend for itself slightly.

U N I T E D  C I V I L I Z E D  S T A T E S
Now we are getting into some buildings more advance and future 
like.

Artillery - Mediocre range and good for making a road into enemy 
territory.

Atomic Power Plants - Creates a set amount of energy. Later in 
can be upgraded. Anything out of range will need an Energy 
Transmitter to help stretch the range. You are better off making 
multiple power plants though.

Energy Transmitter - This will stretch electricity out to the 
farthest reaches of your base.

Fortress - This is tough to beat so build multiple to annoy the 
enemy. Almost the strongest building out (LC beats them).

HeadQuarters - Protect at all cost or your base defenses, 
production, and research will be thrown in disarray and throw you 
out of order.

Heavy Tower - ED equivalent to their Heavy Tower (no resemblance 
or relation). Pretty much has great range but not the best.

Landing Zone - Protect it with your life or your pretty much 
wasted and left any units there that you liked stranded.

Large Tower - ED equivalent to their Large Tower (no resemblance 
or relation). Pretty much good armor and good range.

Plasma Cannon - Must be built in range of the Plasma Control 
Center. Once built you can fire at any place on the map.

Plasma Control Center - Once built satellites are built so then 
the Plasma Cannons can aim off of to shoot enemy bases and units.

Recycler - Same as ED Recycler.

Refinery - This is where your harvesters take the ore. Build it 
near the ore fields or else your harvesters have a long drive and 
money won't come in as fast.

Research Center - In the name. This is where everything is 
researched.

SDI Defense Center - Build this to protect yourself against ED 
(or enemy if they stole the building) atomic rockets.

Shadow Tower - A stationary Camouflage system. Build multiple to 
help hide your base and units to run them in a trap.

Shipyard - Creates the Sea Units of UCS.

Small Tower - Build multiple of these next to each other for 
greatest efficiency.

Supply Depot - Same as ED Supply Depot. You need it for making 
the ammo which your Suppliers come and pick up to deliver to your 
needing units.

Teleport - This will help to teleport units and/or harvesters 
from point A to point B.

Tunnel Entrance - Very small and hard to see. Better than ED so 
its hard to see. Again keep a builder in the tunnel to build 
another entrance just in case.

Vehicle Production Center - Creates all civilian units and can 
fend for itself for a little while.

Weapons Production Center - Creates all military units and can 
fend for itself for a little while.

L U N A R  C O R P O R A T I O N
If you are these people building buildings are made from the 
"Build" tab. Which then are brought down from the Orbital 
Construction Center. So that saves you a unit (or two).

Artillery - Mediocre range and helps makes a path to and from 
enemy territory.

Aerial Supply Depot - Creates the ammo which your units need to 
continue fighting.

Defender - The LC light defender. Make multiple next to each 
other for good efficiency.

Guardian - This over does how well the UCS Fortress is so build 
these in all areas possible.

Headquarters - Same as ED and UCS. Protect at all cost and etc.

Landing Zone - Same as ED and UCS. Protect at all cost and if you 
can't better make due with what you have.

Main Base - This creates all units here. Air units and Ground 
units.  Civilian and Military. Also comes with its own generator 
and own weapon systems so it can defend for its own.

Mine - The LC mine takes place of both the refinery and/or 
harvesters. Must be constructed over Ore Deposits.


Nest - Same as defender but smaller and also works more efficient 
when grouped in multiple numbers.

Recycler - Same as ED and UCS. You get half back for recycling 
your units. Do your part for the moon's environment and recycle.

Research Center - Same as ED and UCS. Research everything here.

SDI Defense - Same as UCS SDI Defense Center. Protects against 
rocket attacks.

Solar Battery - During the day this charges up and stores solar 
power and at night it will power up your base.

Solar Power Plant - Creates energy during the day by having Solar 
Cells collect solar energy and uses it. Leave space for making 
Solar Cells or else its useless.

Weather Control Center - Just leave it to the weather to help 
you. Clear days, rainy days, snowy days, windy days, and meteor 
showers and more can be summoned from here to do your messy work.

Xyrex Power Plant - This creates tons of power which once 
available replace Solar Batteries, Cells, and Plants with since 
its better. But it is quite space consuming.



Weapons
For saving space I will just combine em' and say which weapon is 
able to be built for which faction.

20mm Chaingun - Available to ED, UCS, and LC
It comes with lots of ammo so fire at will. Provides air coverage 
too.

><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><
Strategy
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><
Well now lets get some things down straight for fighting my way 
which usually is really good. The so called "pros" do it by the 
books and keeping the big guns back and using lighter faster ones 
aren't always the best since you need to pack all the heat that 
you can. With UCS take a squad of Panthers, a few Jaguars, throw 
in some good air units and you got it. Before hand use the Plasma 
Cannon if possible to take out a strategic point.  With the sea 
take lots of Hydra and Sharks and you got it. ED takes more 
tactical skills than anything due to they aren't so advance as 
UCS and LC but still able to win. Take many Kruszchev and Urals 
and for air support put some bombers to take out any well 
defended areas or weaken them and than clean em' out with your 
Ural and Kruszchev army take outs everything else. Put your nukes 
to the test and when everything settles immediately follow with 
that force. LC is a time consuming one but the best. A very large 
force of weapon mixed Fat Girls (mix the weapon so you got anti-
air and ground) and Moons and Lunars for back up. Throw in Crions 
and/or Super Fighters for air support and boom. Also before hand 
wipe out an important sector with the weather for some before 
battle coverage. Make due with everything you got. It will be 
your best friend. Also have mobile defenders around your base.

Go all out in fights except for a few and always keep building 
the big guns first during fights just in case something goes 
wrong.

Never use Artillery near your base. They will cause havoc on your 
base more than on the enemy's units or buildings.

And if you have spare cash you can always drop Artilleries near enemy 
base if you are LC.

Well finally you are ready to bad I have nothing on ED or UCS yet 
and I got parts of LC so I will do my best on LC and than update 
this later.

Lunar Corporation Walkthrough
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Mission #1 - Invasion


If you built up before coming a little than this is a piece of 
cake. Grab all units and head on to the mission area. Once there 
grab ALL units and head on to the corner as fast as possible and 
watch out for the constant meteor shower. Once to there soon to 
be base wipe em' out. Forget the artifacts since that takes time 
just go go go and destroy. If there in time well congratulations 
since they will be wiped out since they weren't able to build up 
to a big force. If not than build a big army and go for a battle. 
Once done lets get out! If you want harvest the Ore deposit to 
the right for some money.

Break
If you harvested the little Ore Deposit and transported it back 
to the Main Base than make more units and grow your base. 
Research whats to be researched. Do what you must so you have 
something for the next fight.

Mission #2 - Carpates
You start off with 4 transports. Watch them well. Use one or two 
at a time and pick up the UCS harvesters and drop em'. After all 
22 are gone than build a landing zone and bring in those units 
you should have. Wipe em' out!

Break
I don't know whats to be done now but...relax!

Mission #3 - Convoy
This takes some work.  You start with a lot of Phobes and 6 guys 
in the back which are not yours. Those are the units of the 
convoy.  You got some time. 2 options. Long way or short way. If 
short way (my way) block off the convoy with a laser wall 
COMPLETELY and than build transports and bring all the units home 
safe and quick. That's my way and only way I did it. Long way.  
Well takes creativity so good luck and if you find out e-mail me 
and I will give you credit. If all the units in the convoy made 
it than make a landing zone and bring them home.

Break
Do whats to be done and save since the next one isn't at all 
easy.

Mission #4 - The Shower
Take Fang as soon as possible to the artifact area. Grab em' and 
choose a path. North is to one base and south is to another. I 
choose South but it doesn't matter.  With Fang, fly into one of 
the bases when the timer gets around 15 to 20 seconds left on the 
counter for the next shower and go in. Once 0...RUN!!!!! Get out 
and if any units follow kill em' with your other units.  Wash, 
rinse, and repeat until both bases are destroyed than go home!

Break
Again calm down from an intense and mind boggling battle and go on 
to starting the Sunlight Project.

Mission #5 - The First Ring
Welcome to the hardest series of missions you probably can meet. 
The Sunlight Project has hard hitting opponent only if you don't 
know what you are doing. Well build your Headquarters, Power 
Plants (Xyrex Power Plant preferred but Solar will do for a 
while), and Landing Zone. After those come be everywhere at one. 
You must 1. Start building you base fast but spread out 2. Defend 
against attacks and 3. Ship in money and units from you main 
base. So you make you Power Plants and block that off with a 
laser wall. Than the rest of the base and block that off (as one 
whole) and than building defense buildings close to the wall but 
not blocking it. After that start pumping units if you don't have 
enough (remembering you need enough to take on both bases and you 
need 1 or 2 small ones for the north and south deposits which are 
guarded). Immediately attack, take, and defend the northern 
deposit. Later you can take the southern. Now when you have the 
appropriate amount of force you think you will need for a big 
punch to them march on through the little valley to the other 
side. Destroy the little encampment there and either go straight 
or southeast. If straight you can take out their money supply 
which is advised if you don't want to much interference in 
attacking but you will have to split your group. If you go 
southeast than go south to north in one clean sweep. Either way 
and your done. Well you have to build the two power plants and 
the mine inside the craters but that's not so much work.

Break
Make a camp fire and sing. Well actually rebuild what was lost in 
the last battle and build more since you will need it.

Mission #6 - The Second Ring
Ok build up like in the last one except the deposits are off to 
the side. Once you are ready set out on one of the two side 
paths. Also have an Air Force too to be ready. I prefer Taking 
out Southeast base first due to little resistance. But the other 
side is also good to have taken out major resistance. After both 
are gone and you set up in the craters you make a choice. Use 
strong air force to kick the middle craters but or go under and 
end up in the middle of the crater. Either way go and make home 
there too.

Break
Same as the last break.


Mission #7 - The Third Ring
Somewhat similar to last mission though you are relieved of the 40k 
credit minimum needed.  Also its more spread out and more direct.  
Mainly canyons.  You have one straight left which will constantly 
attack about 20 to 30 minutes into the game.  Than one south and over 
the mountain of your position which will attack around 30 minutes into 
the game but not constant.  And one last one bottom left corner which 
doesn't attack at all.  My approach was flat out Fat Girls and Super 
Fighters but if you have something more preferably as strong and 
effective than by all means use it. Also I suggest air defense near the 
mountain line since the base to the south will attack with air units 
too.  Well once you settled and are ready rush to your left with ground 
units first to grab attention.  Than finish with air units.  Do that 
and sweep the area.  Make home there if you like or just take the 
resources.  Resupply and replace missing units and a little extra.  Now 
I went to the bottom right corner to stop air attacks but if you can 
rough it out than go south from the Northeast base.  For both bases do 
the same but the base south of your Main Base will have more air units 
than normal.  There you go.

Break
Recycle useless or almost destroyed units and do whatever... just build 
up a large army for The Fourth Ring.


Mission #8 - The Fourth Ring
Four bases and you are in the middle.  They are not known to attack you 
much but I wouldn't take chances.  Get comfy fast and pull a blitzkrieg 
war once all units are ready.  It really doesn't matter since all bases 
are in a corner but this strategy is to be used on all.  Be ready for 
air battles and annoying defense buildings.  Do huge hit and runs and 
have suppliers ready. Eventually all 4 bases should be toppled and you 
can get the 60k credit requirement.  If you are short for credits too 
capture buildings and sell them for credits.

Break
Next mission may not be Mission #9 but I would highly suggest it.  And 
get ready for one of the next most aggravating missions.

Mission #9 - Under Fire
This is a finesse mission.  You need your head level and look at the 
big picture. Most of your base will be leveled in a second by artillery 
so I suggest you move your units down.  Now transfer your units over 
and lets get ready.  The good thing is that fang no longer is having a 
Meteor Shower after him.  The bad thing is that you can really build a 
base.  So I suggest any new units be built at main base not mission 
base and later transferred over.  It may get tiring but its more 
effective for me.  Now then...if your units are where you base is/was 
than head left and into the tunnel.  There will be some units but your 
units will make quick work of them.  Now into the tunnel.  The worst 
opposition is in here so be careful.  From where you are go left and up 
as you can until you get to the "T" Intersection.  Make as quick work 
of the force than and recover if need be and go left.  Make more quick 
works and once you hit another "T" go south until you find an exit.  
Head out and north.  Cross the bridge and get the transports.  Now head 
back via tunnel or via air but be careful if by air since you might hit 
the Artillery Base.  Now pick up those harvesters and drop them on the 
artilleries above on the mountain ledge.  Clear the place and now 
extend your base.  The rest of the Artillery Base is past the mountains 
to the right of where the transports initially were.  I left that for 
later but whatever floats your boat.  Get a nice force and either take 
the tunnels for yourself or take the base.  Either way its good. Be 
ready for air and ground resistance...and a lot of it.  Take the base 
and/or tunnel recover and finish the artillery base and you are done.

Break
This break will be totally useless for the next mission so you 
know...whatever.  Build up, relax, and look around or head for the next 
pain in the rear.

Mission #10 - New Hope
This is the hardest mission of this kind I know so far.  Fang and the 
rest of the New Hope vehicles got to get through this.  You need at 
least 2 New Hopes and Fang to survive...the rest are expendable.  You 
have 6 New Hopes, Fang, a Crusher, and 4 Super Fighters in the South 
Base.  Use them all wisely.  This mission is finesse yet "EVERY MAN, 
WOMAN, AND CHILD FOR THEMSELVES!!" since there are some big guys here 
and a part that is blocked by mines.  So open up the laser wall and get 
the shield upgrades than head left until there is a break. Continue 
left and around the corner.  There should be a tunnel entrance 
somewhere nearby that bend.  Go in and go to the opposite side to go by 
all the busy action and mines above. Once out go south and follow the 
path...there will be some resistance but not as much as I found the first 
time not taking the tunnel.  Soon the canyon turns and than goes into a 
"T".  Go south, finish the resistance and run home!

Break
Now that the easy part is done lets get ready for the real action.

Mission #11 - Deadly Toys
He is not kidding when he says deadly toys.  There are 3 of them too.  
Well I can't give much advice besides bum rush them all and call in 
reinforcements when needed.  Also the 3 are on Plateaus.  One direct 
right from you, one south and over the mountains from you, and one 
bottom right corner.

Break
Now that there is a break in the weather get ready for the last mission 
that I know of which requires a lot of units.

Mission #12 - Payback Time
I have yet to beat this mission and I know nothing of the opposition 
but I assume 4 enemy bases in the corners and artillery somewhere.  You 
get attack right from the start so be ready and transfer a lot of units 
as possible...and cash too.  UCS goes all out and it is annoying.  Have 
probes ready and scan fast.  Look for the artillery and destroy them.  
That's all I know of since I am working on it.

United Civilized States Walkthrough
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
You start off by getting a message that you have 2 prototypes 
units which have to make it to the Space Port in Florida. So 
select both units and head out the cave.  Once you leave you hear 
that the ED and LC both know about Space Port and plan to destroy 
it.  Continue to the left and follow your nose to the base above 
your current position.  There you can start your harvesters and 
take a break since on the way you will receive heavy action from 
the ED tanks and other wise.  From their head to the space port 
or destroy either/or/both the ED and LC base for the reward.  Be 
prepared though since both bases will put up a fight you will 
never forget.  Once at the Space Port load up the 2 units and 
head to the moon.
This is all I have gotten in the UCS campaigns because I can't 
seem to just forgot about attacking the LC and ED bases.
