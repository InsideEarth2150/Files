THE MOON PROJECT FAQ/WALKTHRU version 1.1

by Michael Lo



				FOREWORD

	There doesn't seem to any real faqs for this game except for
one abortive effort.  I think it's a shame as Moon Project is a pretty
interesting and innovative real-time strategy game.  So here's the
first faq/walkthrough.  I hope you find it helpful and informative.

understand but don't go and copy it to sell to obnoxious gaming magazines.


UPDATE
-Version 1.1
included stats of Headquarters for UCS and ED which were forgotten in the
first version.  Also cleaned up some grammatical errors and other minor
mistakes

0.1 WHAT IS THIS GAME ABOUT?

	Well some time in the mid-21st century, a global nuclear war broke out
and 3 major powers arose.  The former remnants of the Eastern Europe would
take over Asia and Western Europe forming the Eurasian Dynasty or ED.
Tensions grew as the Eurasian Dynasty went on a war of conquest.  The United
States couldn't handle the armies of the Eurasian Dynasty initially but
when they developed combat robot technology and an AI system to use them,
they succeeded in battling the ED for control.  As the AI system became more
advanced and was given increasing control of the government, the US would
become the UCS and start a scenario reminiscent of the Terminator movies.
The ED could barely hold the onslaught by the USC and so unleashed a barrage
of nukes on the Arctic to halt the advance.

	Unfortunately this had the effect of destabilizing the orbit of the
Earth and so humanity is doomed unless they can get off the planet.
Ironically the UCS survived the nuclear attack quite well due to its SDI
facilities.  And so now the two factions duke it out for survival once
more.  Also the Lunar Corporation, a long forgotten  experimental colony
of scientists and engineers have also joined the fray to save what they can
of humanity.  Complicating this race for survival is the discovery of alien
technology that could alter the balance of power.

0.2 HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?

	Before anything, it's best to read the manual first as it provides
important information about the Moon Project.  After that you should try the
tutorial section of each faction so that you know how each faction works.
Finally before you really get into the game you might want to run a skirmish
game or two at either Tech War or Uncle Sam.  Tech War gives you unlimited
money and all pertinent researches barring a couple of economy oriented items
while Uncle Sam gives you a regular payment of money over time so you don't
have to worry about harvesting resources and their eventual depletion.
These two skirmish games gives you the opportunity to see test out the
technology of each side especially in the higher end of the tech spectrum.

	The Moon Project is different than most other games in that the money
earned and the units made in previous scenarios can be ported over to the
current mission.  This means that great success in a previous missions can
put you at an advantage.  Also some missions have sub-missions that can net
you bonuses, they're often unnecessary but can provide something of an
economic boost.

	In terms of combat, energy weapons bypass armor and directly harms
the unit or building itself.  In addition energy weapons have an ammo supply
that is self-charging, every time you fire a shot your weapon automatically
starts recharging.  Size of ammo supplies only determines how many shots
before you have used up all the charges in a weapon and MUST allow a recharge
of at least 1 shot.  In essence energy weapons have unlimited ammo.  Energy
weapons also tend to be the more damaging weapons in the game.  The drawbacks?
Energy weapons are blocked by shields and also tend to have less range than
projectile weapons.

	Projectile weapons have their damage dissipated by armor but goes through
shields unhindered.  Projectile weapons also tend to be the longest ranged in
the game.  Besides having the damage reduced by armor, projectile weapons also
have a limited supply of ammo.  Once they run out, a supply ship must go to a
supply depot to stock up on ammo and then deliver it.  Note that the damage
rating given for a weapon (energy or projectile) is the most common amount of
damage inflicted per attack, the damage can be several times greater or lower
than this average depending on your luck.

	Besides combat on the surface, underground tunnels can be built and fought
on.  There are also naval units in the game though that aspect isn't touched on
much in the single-player mode.

	Experience and technology can turn the tide of battle.  Gain experience
by successfully destroying enemy units and buildings.  Utilize technological
gains by producing new buildings, units and weapons or upgrading existing ones.
Also there are helpful artifacts lying around that can help you including more
credits, shield projectors and repair

	In the end, the manual can tell you more (though they take what they say
with a grain of salt) and there's nothing like getting some fights under your belt
before tackling the real campaigns.

1.0				THE EURASIAN DYNASTY

	These guys are the villains of the story.  It was their habit of invading
other countries and the use of a massive nuclear strike that started this mess
in the first place.  Ignore what the manual says about these guys being the most
primitive faction in the game.  The ED are the tops in certain technological areas
that they focus on and even where they lag behind, they're not push-overs.

Pros
-The ED excel in long-ranged bombardment what with their artillery, ballistic rockets
and nukes.

-Like all the other factions, they have some impressive energy weapons-though
none of their energy weapons causes any actual damage.  With these weapons they
can easily capture or detonate enemy units

-They are very effective in arming their buildings with a wide variety of weapons.

-While their light units are little more than target practice, their heavy units
are just as tough as anyone else's and excel in hitting power.

-They possess a number of amphibious attack units for sneak attacks from the
water.

-They have some cheap fake vehicles that are harmless but can provide decoys for
the real thing.

-They also have a unit with stealth capability

Cons
-Their air force is the worst of all three factions as they lack any particular
strength that the other factions have in the air.

-When it comes to mining, the ED takes more time to get the cashflow going as they
have to build a mine and a refinery plus a power plant to run them.

-They need a power plant fairly close by for all their buildings and there's nothing
they can do to improve the situation.

-Their early units are very weak and are easy pickings for the other factions as well.
Still once they get going, they come on hard

1.2	********EURASIAN DYNASTY EQUIPMENT********
	*Numbers in brackets refer to the building version

Banner
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 0
Hard Points: Light

Universal to all factions, the banner gives your units something
to rally around and so gives the units and buildings in range
2 experience ranks.

20mm Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 15
	  17 +2
	  19 +2
	  21 +2
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

Chainguns are practically useless against anything with armor greater
than 25%.  It's a weapon that can be effective in the early stages
but later on even with full weapon and ammo upgrades it becomes
something of a novelty with its low damage and short range.

The main benefit of a Chaingun is its high ammo supply, instant delivery
and ability to shoot targets in the air-it has a high rate of fire but so
do many other weapon types.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded
20mm bullets add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +2 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

20mm Double Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 23
	  26 +3
	  29 +3
	  32 +3
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200 (400)

The 20mm Chaingun upgrades to the 20mm Double Chainguns.  The Double Chaingun
has slightly  more damage than unmodified Rocket Launchers and has superior
damage improvement over the ordinary Chaingun when using upgraded bullets.
While they go through bullets faster due to the dual barrels, the enlarged
magazine more than covers the increased ammunition needs.  Unfortunately
this weapon lacks the firepower and range to be effective as the enemy develops
more armored vehicles.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+3 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

AA Gun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 200
	  240  +40
	  320  +80
	  400  +80
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

The AA Gun is the most powerful anti-aircraft weapon available to the ED.
It can easily shoot down any aircraft especially when it's ammo has been
upgraded.  The quickness of its delivery means that enemy aircraft can't
really jink to get out of the way.  It does have some problems with range
though.  But in all this is probably my favorite anti-aircraft weapon with
the AA plasma gun can very close runner-up.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +40 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +80 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+80 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +200 damage and +1 Range

20mm Helicopter Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 15
	17 +2
	19 +2
        21 +2
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100

The only difference between this and the regular version is that the
range for the Helicopter Chaingun is better and it takes longer to make.
Still it can give an aircraft a viable means of attacking ground targets
and with a large ammo supply it can sustain this for a long time.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+2 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

20mm Helicopter Double Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 23
	26 +3
	29 +3
	32 +3
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200

The only difference between this and the 20mm Double Chaingun is the range and
time needed to make this.  Can be an effective weapon at distracting groundbased foes.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+3 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

105mm Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 30
	  33 +3
	  36 +3
	  39 +3
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
       8 (10) +1
Ammo: 60 (100)

This is probably the first significant offensive weapon in the game.  The level of
damage it inflicts is unimpressive against heavy armor but for units with little or
no armor, the 105mm cannon can be fairly devastating.  The biggest advantage is
that this weapon delivers its attacks almost instanteously.  The biggest drawback
is that rate of fire is slow

Level 1 upgraded 105mm bullets adds +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2 upgraded
105mm bullets add +3 to the damage.  Level 3 upgraded 105mm bullets add +4 damage
and +1 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +10 damage and +2 Range

105mm Double Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 46
        50 +4
	55 +5
	61 +6
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
       8 (10) +1
Ammo: 120 (200)

With the damage going up by more than 50%, this cannon will land some potent
hits especially against foes with little or no armor.  This is still not very
effective against main battle tanks and their like.

Level 1 upgraded 105mm bullets adds +4 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2 upgraded
105mm bullets add +5 to the damage.  Level 3 upgraded 105mm bullets add +6 damage
and +1 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +15 damage and +2 Range

120mm Cannon
Cost: 700 (600) credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Projectile
Damage: 50
	63 +13
	69 +6
	71 +2
Range: 8 (10)
       9 (11) +1
       10 (12) +1
       11 (13) +1
Ammo: 100

The large bore on this cannon gives it a lot of firepower and can be a reliable
weapon for mounting on tanks.  Still when fighting armored foes expect the fight
to last quite a while.  Note that if more firepower is needed, a light weapon can
be placed as a submount for this cannon.  The building version cannot use submount
weapons

Level 1 upgraded 120mm bullets adds +13 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2 upgraded
120mm bullets add +6 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 120mm bullets add
+2 damage and +1 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +21 damage and +3 Range

       10 (12) +1
       11 (13) +1
Ammo: 100 (200)

This can be a potent projectile weapon especially when given fully upgraded
ammunition.  It can even be of use against units with heavy armor, just remember
that the firing rate is slow.

Level 1 upgraded 120mm bullets adds +20 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2 upgraded
120mm bullets add +10 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 120mm bullets
add +3 damage and +1 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +33 damage and +3 Range

The ED Rocket Launcher isn't much better than its 20mm chaingun outside
of its range.  It'll do in the short term but you'll want to upgrade this quickly,
also beware of the limited ammunition supply on this weapon.  Upgrading ammunition
not only improves damage but makes the rockets guided.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +2 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +2 damage, increases the guidance
system  to 50% and increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an
additional +2 damage-so having all the Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher
will give you +6 damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

Ammo: 75 (150)

A fair improvement in damage and ammunition supply but it is still not very
powerful and is fairly weak against armored units and buildings.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +3 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +3 damage, increases the guidance
system  to 50% and increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives
an additional +4 damage-so having all the Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher
will give you +10 damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

This level of rocket launcher finally makes the ED rocket launcher a respectable
weapon with improved damage and ammo supplies.  Still it's not too effective
against heavy armor

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +4 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +4 damage, increases the guidance
system  to 50% and increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an

The only difference between this and ground version is that the ground version
has a lot more ammo.  Still this weapon gives a helicopter some degree of firepower
against air and ground units.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +2 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +2 damage, increases the guidance
system  to 50% and increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an

The ED Heavy Rocket Launcher provides good firepower against air and ground
targets, it's especially effective when armed with upgraded rockets.  While the
building version has a large cache of rockets to draw on, the unit version has
only a small supply.

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system
of 25%.  Upgraded Level 2 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage and a guidance system of
50%.  Upgraded Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance
system of 100%.  Having all 3 levels gives +12 damage, +2 Range and guidance 100%

Range: 10 (12)
       11 (13) +1
       12 (14) +1
Ammo: 45 (150)

A fairly sizeable improvement to the damage and the ammo supply increases, this is
a great weapon for any occasion but it is especially effective in defensive work

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +6 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system  of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Heavy Rocket gives +7 damage and a guidance system of 50%.  Upgraded
Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +6 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system of 100%.  Having
all 3 levels gives +19 damage, +2 Range and guidance 100%

At this point the Heavy Rocket Launcher can provide heavy damage to any target
and has enough ammunition to last a few sorties.

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +8 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system  of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Heavy Rocket gives +8 damage and a guidance system of 50%.  Upgraded
Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +8 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system of 100%.  Having

The power and effectiveness of this weapon is identical to that of the ground
version.  With enough upgrades this weapon can provide strong firepower from
the skies.

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system
of 25%.  Upgraded Level 2 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage and a guidance system of
50%.  Upgraded Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance

Range: 25
       30 +5
       40 +10
       70 +30
Ammo: 1

The most devastating weapon that can be mounted on a unit, this is the weapon of
choice for breaking open enemy bases.  It's very costly but it's without a doubt
one of the best weapons in the game as it easily devastates anything in its blast
radius

Level 1 upgraded Ballistic Rocket adds +500 to the damage and +5 range.  Level 2
upgraded Ballistic Rocket adds +500 to the damage and +10 range.  Nuclear Ballistic
Rocket adds 1500 damage and +30 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +2500
damage and +45 Range

Nuclear Warheads
Cost: 2000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special
Type: Projectile
Damage: 500
Range: 25
Ammo: 4

Further testament to the ED's superiority in extreme long range bombardment.
This weapon inflicts heavy damage at long ranges from the safety of a submerged
submarine.  It is gained from researching the ballistic rocket launcher

Nuclear Warheads upg.1
Cost: 3000 credits
Time needed: 2 minutes 5 seconds
Hard Points: Special
Type: Projectile
Damage: 700
Range: 40
Ammo: 4

This weapon while costlier and more time consuming to produce, is better
in every other respect.  It is gained as soon as the Kiev II and ballistic rocket
launcher is researched

Artillery

	275 +25
	300 +25
	325 +25
Range: 25
       26 +1
Ammo: 120

This is essentially a modified 120mm Double Cannon with much heavier damage potential
and great range.  This weapon provides some serious firepower

Level 1 upgraded 120mm bullets adds +25 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 120mm
bullets add +25 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 120mm bullets add
+25 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +75 damage and +1 Range

An extremely powerful weapon that has a large blast radius, use with caution to
avoid friendly fire

Level 1 upgraded bomb adds +160 to damage.  Level 2 upgraded bomb adds +160 to
damage.  Nuclear bomb adds +320 to damage.  Having all 3 upgrades gives +640 to
damage.

The only difference is larger capacity for holding bombs

Laser Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 60
Range: 6 (7)
Ammo: 16

The damage rating for the laser cannon is somewhat misleading.  The Laser Cannon
doesn't actually inflict physical damage, what it does is heat up a target until
it becomes red-hot and explodes-if you don't heat up a target long enough then
there's no effect as the target eventually cools off.  The thing is against vehicles
it can do this rapidly and the beam bypasses armor so lasers are very effective
against units.  Lasers also don't use much energy and so you'll rarely see much
of a dip in its ammo count even during heavy fighting.

The drawback with the laser is that it takes a long time to heat up buildings
even when using upgraded and heavy laser cannons.  As well it's one of the shortest
ranged weapons around.  It's still a very potent weapon when use it to its strength

Laser Cannon upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 90
Range: 6 (7)
Ammo: 16

The damage level goes up by a large amount and so it becomes easier to break open
enemy units, too bad nothing else has improved

Laser Cannon upg.2
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 120
Range: 6 (7)
Ammo: 16

The damage level puts many heavy weapons to shame.  Only with strong shields
can enemy units survive this level of energy output

Heavy Laser Cannon
Cost: 700 (600) credits
Time needed: 55 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 120
Range: 7 (8)
Ammo: 16

The bane of tanks, this weapon gets some improvement in the range department
over its smaller relative but it's the level of firepower that's really telling.
And wait until you get the upgraded versions.  To top it off, the Heavy Laser Cannon
can use submounted weapons though at this level the building version cannot.

Heavy Laser Cannon upg.1
Cost: 700 (600) credits
Time needed: 55 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 180
Range: 7 (8)
Ammo: 16

The Heavy Laser Cannon upg.1 has a huge increase in damage and now the building
version can use submounted weapons as well.

Heavy Laser Cannon upg.2
Cost: 700 (600) credits
Time needed: 55 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 240
Range: 7 (8)
Ammo: 16

Anything mounting this level of firepower should be approached with caution
and the heaviest level of shielding.

Ion Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
Range: 7 (9)
Ammo: 1

The Ion Cannon is designed for capturing enemy units and buildings, it's not capable
of destroying them.  However it takes only one shot on an unshielded target to shock
them temporarily into paralysis and if you fire enough shots you'll permanently
disable the target until they get repaired (LC units and buildings can never be
permanently disabled).  Also the range is decent by energy weapon standards.

The big drawback is that the ion bolt is fairly slow moving, is slow to rotate and has
a low firing rate due to it being a single-shot weapon.  Also watch that you don't
catch your own units in friendly fire

Ion Cannon upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
Range: 7 (9)
Ammo: 1 (2)

Upon first appearance there's no improvement but actually the time it takes to recharge
is greatly diminished.  The building version also gets a bit more ammo

Heavy Ion Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 10 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 500
Range: 7 (9)
Ammo: 1 (2)

The Heavy Ion Cannon inflicts huge damage against shields, only a few shots and it
can reach the vulnerable target.  Also it easily disables targets with the level of
energy it puts out.  Otherwise there's little in the way of difference between this
and the light version

Heavy Ion Cannon upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 10 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 500
Range: 7
Ammo: 1

Like the Ion Cannon upg.1, the improvement lies in the more rapid recharging rate.
There is no building version of this weapon

Earthquake Generator
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 16
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 3

The damage is unimpressive to say the least and doesn't harm enemy units.  But
this can be a great weapon for attacking enemy buildings if they're too heavily
defended for air or ground assaults.  It will work when you're underground and
allows you to attack the surface from the tunnels, just click on the ground in
front of you (not the building or you'll try to go back to the surface to launch
a direct attack) and it will attack every building in a radius.  Remember the damage
is really low and it doesn't affect enemy units, so trying to use this in a full
frontal attack is suicide.

Earthquake Generator upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 30
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 5

The damage is still unimpressive but a marked improvement over the original.
A pair of these mounted on a tank with two hard points can really work over
a building.

Carrier
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This item holds resources gathered from the mine to take to the refinery.
It can only be mounted on a Taiga.

Container Hook
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This item holds resources gathered from the mine to take to the refinery.
It can only be mounted on a Unit Transporter enabling it to do aerial deliveries.

Transport Hook
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This is what enables a transporter to carry units up.  Can only be used
by Unit Transporters

Repairer
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This item repairs damaged units and buildings at 20 HP per second.  The rate
goes up if more than one repairer are working-with a maximum of 4 repairers
at once.  It can also capture enemy units and buildings that have been disabled
Only the Taiga and Irkutsk can carry a repairer

Repairer upg.1
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Point: Special

The Repairer upg.1 repairs damage at 40 HP per second.  Also it can upgrade
units on the field-the manual isn't quite right.   The repairer can indeed
upgrade the chasis of a unit in addition to adding shields and new versions
of an existing weapon.  What it cannot do is change the equipment type of a
unit-a repairer suddenly can't mount a laser cannon for example.

Building Grabber
Cost: 600 credits
Time Needed: 10 seconds
Hard Points: Light

Gives you quick ability to capture enemy buildings as you don't
need to ionize them first.

Noise Generator
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Point: Light

The Noise Generator or Screamer enables a unit or building to detect enemy
stealth units.  Also it prevents you from commanding your units-they instead
revert to whatever AI commands that would normally taken in the situation.
As the AI opponent typically doesn't do platoons or elaborate maneuvers, the
noise generator is mainly useful as a way to detect stealthy attackers.

Noise Generator upg.1
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Point: Light

Improves the distance of detection and disruption

Noise Generator upg.2
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Point: Light

Improves the distance of detection and disruption even further

Power Shield Generator 600 PSU
Cost: 100 credits

The lowest level of shield generator available and offers decent protection
against energy weapons

Power Shield Generator 1200 PSU
Cost: 200 credits

The mid-level shield generator offers strong protection against energy weapons

Power Shield Generator 1800 PSU
Cost: 400 credits

The heavy shield generator can really take enormous pounding from energy weapons

TT 100 Pamir
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 180
Armor: 75%
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 1 Special

Designed from plans for the M1 Abrahms, this is probably the weakest tank
in the game.  It has very little toughness for something designed specifically
to fight and while it is fast, it doesn't compare well to other quick units.
The Pamir has a very limited selection of useable equipment-with weapons being
limited to rocket launcher, 105mm cannon and AA gun.  Finally it cannot carry
shields and this never improves.  To its credit the Pamir does have heavy armor
and is one of the few units capable of carrying the AA gun so it can pose a
significant danger to aircraft.

TT 110 Pamir
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 210
Armor: 75%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Special

Improvements made on toughness and speed still aren't enough to make this tank
little more than cannonfodder.

TT 120 Pamir
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 75%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Special

Toughness goes up another notch.  This isn't a significant improvement and everything
that's said about the Pamir still stands.  Ah, well.  What can you expect from a
tank that's largely based on souped-up 20th century technology

HT 400 Kruszchev
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Now this is a tank!  Very tough, heavily armored and packing a large gun.  The main
draw back is that it's somewhat pokey initially.  Still itt beats using a Pamir any day
this is the result when using futuristic technology instead of cheap 20th century knockoffs.

HT 500 Kruszchev
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1200
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The toughness goes up significantly as does the speed.  The HT 500 Kruszchev makes for
a viable main battle tank unless you have the money to stick with the Ural

HT 800 Ural
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 20 seconds
HP: 1350
Armor: 75%
Speed: 14
Hard Points: 2 Heavy

Tougher than the Kruszchev and certainly packing more firepower, if you can afford the cost
of its weaponry then you just might want to make the Ural your main battle tank.

HT 900 Ural
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1500
Armor: 75%
Speed: 14
Hard Points: 2 Heavy

The Ural gets even more toughness making it a powerful juggernaut of a tank.

TK 100 Caspian
Cost: 500 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 25%
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Caspian is the earliest amphibious vehicle of the ED.  It's moderately tough and
armored plus it is very quick in addition to being amphibious.  The main drawback is
that it can only use a Power Shield Generator 600 PSU which never improves and has but
a single light hard point.

TK 110 Caspian
Cost: 500 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Light

Tougher and faster, the Caspian makes a great scout and when danger threatens just jump
in the water.

TK 111 Caspian
Cost: 500 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 750
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Light

Yeah the Caspian is once again tougher but the really big change is that the Caspian
can mount an AA gun.  You might want to have a couple of designated anti-air Caspians
kicking around.

TL 70 Volga
Cost: 1400 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 10 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This heavy tank is designed for amphibious operations, specifically long range bombardment
from the water or land.  It's tough, heavily armored and very well armed.  It poses a
significant threat to vehicles that can't reach it

TL 80 Volga
Cost: 1400 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 10 seconds
HP: 1050
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Volga gains more toughness, enabling to stand a lot of punishment until it can make a
run for the water or land.

STEALTH
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 25%
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 1 Light

Unmentioned in the manual, the STEALTH is little more than an early model Caspian with
a personal shadow generator that covers only itself and no amphibious capabililty.
So long as it doesn't shine on the lights or encounter foes with detection equipment
than the STEALTH can spy or attack with impunity.  Outfit it with an Ion Cannon or Laser
and it can really do some damage.

ZT 200 Minelayer
Cost: 500 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 18
Ammo: 10
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Minelayer carries 10 mines and can also be used to ferret out enemy minefields.
On its own its no slouch but you'll still want to give it some flankers as its fighting
ability isn't the greatest and it won't intiate attacks.

ZT 210 Minelayer
Cost: 570 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 675
Armor: 50%
Speed: 19
Ammo: 20
Hard Points: 1 Light

This ZT 210 Minelayer gains more toughness, armor and speed.  This pushes
the toughness and armor to respectable levels.  The improvements should greatly
increase its survivability but you still want some escort in case a fight breaks out.
It's supply of mines are also doubled.

ZK Taiga

Armor: 0%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Taiga is the all-purpose vehicle of the ED.  It's the only ground unit capable of
carrying resources or a repairer and it can provided limited combat support when equipped
with a light weapon

ZK Taiga 2
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

The only improvement made on the Taiga is a boost of speed.

ZT 100 Siberia
Cost: 450 credits
Time needed: 35 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Light

According to the manual, supposedly this vehicle was designed for combat from
tinkering with the Taiga.  However in that role it's not particularly impressive.
The toughness of the Siberia isn't enough as there's no armor on it and its
weaponry isn't particularly outstanding.  It also lacks the versatility of
the Taiga in terms of non-combat roles.

ZT 101 Siberia
Cost: 450 credits
Time needed: 35 seconds
HP: 675
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

A faster and tougher Siberia, it still doesn't hold up that well in combat

ZT 102 Siberia
Cost: 450 credits
Time needed: 35 seconds
HP: 750
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Siberia gets tougher than before but that lack of armor plays a real factor.

Gruz
Cost: 800 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
HP: 1800
Armor: 0
Speed: 19

The Gruz is the construction vehicle of the ED and is vital for building new
buildings and landscaping the terrain.  It can only mount light shield generators

Ukraine
Cost: Special
Time needed: Special
HP: 1500
Armor: 75%
Speed: Special
Hard Points: 0

The Ukraine is the transporter that ferries your troops between your main base,
your subsidiary bases and the mission site.  You always start with one and can move
it between landing zones.  Up to 15 units and 5000 credits can be carried at one time.

Unit Transporter
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 550
Armor: 50%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: Special

Extremely fast and well armored, the Unit Transporter can usually deliver ground units
safely or it can pick up stationary enemy units to drop to their deaths.  The ED Unit
Transporter can also be equipped with a cargo hook enabling it to transfer resources
from the mine to the refinery

MI 27 Boyar
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 0
Speed: 32

The supply ship of the ED which is exactly the same as everyone else's.  It's fast and
very durable unfortunately it has no armor so anti-aircraft fire will make short work
of it.  Without an adequate number of Boyars and supply depots, you won't have enough
ammo to sustain a long fight.

MI 106 Cossack
Cost: 350 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 0
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The speedy attack helicopter of the ED, unfortunately it's very easy to destroy given
that it has no armor.  Not that much of a problem unless fighting the UCS, the Cossack
cannot mount shields either.

MI 107 Cossack
Cost: 350 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 0
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The only improvement made for this model is an upgrade to its toughness.

MI 140 Grozny
Cost: 450 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

Just as fast as the Cossack, it's fair ways tougher and also carries some armor.
An improvement in almost every way over the Cossack, it can mount up to a
light shield projector

MI 150 Grozny
Cost: 450 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 375
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The MI 150 Grozny gains more toughness and the ability to use the medium
shield generator

MI 300 Thor
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 375
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The first bomber of the ED, the Thor isn't particularly tough but it has a lot
of firepower to back up any action.  It can carry only up to the medium
shield generator and this doesn't improve

MI 310 Thor
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed:  1 minute
HP: 450
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Thor gains some more toughness but the hope is that you can instead
gravitate to the superior Han.


MI 200 Han
Cost: 1300 credits
Time needed:  1 minute
HP: 600
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Far superior to the Thor but more expensive, the Han is well-equipped to battle
most units and defensive structures.  It can carry only up to the medium
shield generator and this doesn't improve

MI 210 Han
Cost: 1300 credits
Time needed:  1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Han gains significantly more toughness and is well matched against any
of the other factions' heavy bombers.

ESS 30 Irkutsk
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 50%
Speed 21
Hard Points: 1 Light

The speedy cutter of the ED, the Irkutsk is an effective patrol boat and in
numbers can act as a deterent against attacks against your navy.  The Irkutsk
can also be used for civilian roles such as a repairer for naval units as well as
being capable of packing the AA gun

ESS 40 Irkutsk
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 560
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Light

Some more toughness and speed have been added to the Irkutsk, which improves
on the role of patrolling the water ways.

ESS 200 Leviathan
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1400
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     1 Light

The heavy cruiser of the ED can carry a large arsenal of weaponry including ones
for long range bombardment.  The Leviathan is heavily armored and is tougher
than any tank, just the thing to designate as a flaghip

ESS 300 Leviathan
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1600
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     2 Light

The Leviathan gets more toughness and speed but the real bonus is the additional
light mount.

Kiev
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: I minute
HP: 450
Armor: 50%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: Special

The Kiev is designed to be deployed below normal sight underwater.  The only
purpose of a Kiev or Kiev II serves is to be able fire nukes at the enemy, however
the nukes used by a Kiev are much, much weaker than the ones from a silo or
ballistic rocket launcher

Kiev II
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: I minute
HP: 550
Armor: 50%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: Special

The Kiev gets an increase in toughness and speed plus the Nuclear Warhead upg.1

1.4	********EURASIAN DYNASTY BUILDINGS********
	*ED buildings have the widest variety of equipment to choose from for
	their hard points

Landing Zone
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 0 power
HP: 300
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

In the campaign this is one of the most important buildings in the game.
The landing zone allows you to transfer money and resources from a mission
site back to your home base and vice versa.

Power Plant
Size: 1x2
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: provides 200 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Provides a large supply of energy to power your buildings within a certain
vicinity

Vehicle Production Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
             1 Light

Produces civilian ground and air vehicles (any chassis type that isn't outfitted
with a weapon).  The ED Vehicle Production Center has some fairly significant
firepower with 2 hard points

Weapon Production Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 2000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 4000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Produces military ground and air vehicles (any chassis type that is outfitted
with a weapon).

Ship Yard
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 5400
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
             1 Light

The Ship Yard actually only takes 5 squares of space though you're not likely to be
able to fit a building in the empty space.  The Ship Yard can only be built on a
limited variety of shoreline, so don't expect to be able to regularly make use of
this.  That said though the Ship Yard is a very powerful building at defending itself
with its large amounts of toughness, heavy armor and 2 hard points.  The Ship Yard
produces all naval vehicles and so you should make sure to explore a potential site
extensively so that you don't trap your ships in little more than a pond.

Supply Depot
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Actually the supply depot only takes up 3 squares of space.  The Supply Depot stocks
Boyar helicopters with ammunition to take to units and buildings that
use projectile weapons.  Make sure to have enough supply depots and Boyar helicopters

Mine
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Actually the mine only takes up 5 squares, the mine must be placed on a location of
resources.  The mine not only extracts resources directly below it but will also extract
from areas up to 2 squares away.

Refinery
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Actually the refinery only takes up 5 squares, the refinery takes resources from either
the Unit Transporter or Taiga and converts it into credits

Headquarters
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Headquarters can automate your base defense, the construction of units, upgrading of
building weapons and research paths.  It takes one Headquarters for each assignment.

However I find only the automation of your base defense to be useful.  The computer is
notorious for making poor choices in other areas.  With base defense though, it'll open
fire at incoming foes from maximum range.

Recycler
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Actually the recycler only takes up 5 squares, it takes in units and recycles them
into credits worth half the original value of the unit.  For the most part you're
better off just upgrading veteran units unless they're really obsolete

Research Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

For researching new technologies, each research Center after one gives a +10% bonus
for faster research.  There's no improvement for having more than 3 research Center
as +20% is the maximum bonus

Radar
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 750
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

This small building provides a large radius of scanning in order to detect stealth units.
Ignore what it mentions in the manual, the radar DOES NOT scramble enemy communications

Tunnel Entrance
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 1500
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The Tunnel Entrance is the point of entry where units can go underground through a
series of tunnels.

Walls
Resource Cost: 10 credits

Erects a strong stone wall that can take quite a bit of punishment without collapsing

Narrow Bridge
Resource Cost: 50 credits

Forms a bridge that is one square in width

Wide Bridge
Resource Cost: 50 credits

Forms a bridge that is 2 squares in width.

Small Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 200 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 350
Armor: 50%
Hard Points: 1 Light

A short defensive structure that can defend itself from attack with its weapon.
Unfortunately it is sorely lacking in firepower and toughness.  The biggest
advantage is that the Small Tower does not cost energy.  This building starts
off with a 20mm chaingun

Large Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 1800
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This is a very strong defensive structure with lots of toughness, heavy armor
and capable of holding a powerful weapon.  Its height enables it to shoot clearly
over most buildings.  It starts off with a 105mm cannon if you have that technology

Heavy Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 750 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 1350
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
             2 Light

The manual forgot to list this as one of the ED's buildings.  Not as tall or tough
as the Large Tower, the Heavy Tower more than makes up for it by carrying a lot of
firepower.  The Heavy Tower can handle almost any threat provided you have some support.
It starts off with a 105mm cannon and a pair of 20mm chainguns if you have the technology.

Pillbox
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 600 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The toughest defensive structure of the ED, the pillbox is short enough to let
many friendly units to fire over it.  It doesn't match the Heavy Tower for firepower
but a few pillboxes can easily contain most foes

Artillery
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 5000 credits
Energy Cost: 100 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Type: Projectile
Damage: 800
Range: 60
Ammo: 3
Hard Points: 0

Far and away the most damaging artillery building of the 3 factions.  This is fantastic
for bombarding targets from safe distances and also makes a powerful base defense when
set to fire at will and in a proper line formation.  Just keep in mind to avoid friendly fire

Missile Control Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 10000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, this is easily the least power consuming though
it can be very costly in credits as each nuclear missile costs 5000 credits to arm.
The Missile Control Center can build up to 4 silos each.

Silos
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 15000 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Type: Projectile
Damage: 4000
Range: 300
Hard Points: 0

This facility stores and launches nuclear missiles for inflicting absolutely incredible damage
on the enemy.  The nukes are extremely effective against heavily shielded but unarmored targets,
however it less so against targets with heavy armor

2.0				THE UNITED CIVILIZED STATES

	While they're not quite the bad guys that the ED is, they're not exactly a moral bunch
either and do occasionally play the villain.  The manual makes them sound pretty intimidating
and they actually live up to it.

Pros
-Their excellent power facilities and ease of mining helps get the UCS a head start.

-They have units who are tougher than the others in the early stages of the game.

-In combat they have a wide variety of good weapons for dispatching foes at mid to
long range.  They have some of the best rocket launchers in the game.  Their plasma
cannons give them heavy firepower in any situation, once they develop the AA plasma
gun it's good night enemy aircraft.

-They have some unique items such as teleports and shadow generators that give them
a lot of sneakiness.

-They have the best defensive buildings in the game.

-Finally their air force are the best when it comes to attacking ground targets.

Cons
-Unfortunately their ground units tend to be slow and almost all of their units are
more expensive than everyone else's.

-They're not as good as everyone else when it comes to arming their buildings.
Their selection is too limited and lacks weapon submounts

-They also lack really disruptive weapons and so tend to be a rigid in a fight.
Still the UCS start strong and finish strong too

Banner
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 0
Hard Points: Light

Universal to all factions, the banner gives your units something
to rally around and so gives the units and buildings in range
2 experience ranks.

20mm Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 15
	17 +2
	19 +2
	21 +2
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

Chainguns are practically useless against anything with armor more
than 25%.  It's a weapon that can be effective in the early stages
but later on even with full weapon and ammo upgrades it becomes something
of a novelty with its low damage and short range.

The main benefit of a Chaingun is its high ammo supply, instant delivery
and ability to shoot targets in the air-it has a high rate of fire but so
do many other weapon types

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded
20mm bullets add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +2 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage
and +1 Range

20mm Double Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 23
	26 +3
	29 +3
 	32 +3
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200 (400)

The 20mm Chaingun upgrades to the 20mm Double Chainguns.  The Double Chaingun
has slightly  more damage than unmodified Rocket Launchers and has superior
damage improvement over the ordinary Chaingun when using upgraded bullets.
While they go through bullets faster due to the dual barrels, the enlarged
magazine more than covers the increased ammunition needs.  Unfortunately this
weapon lacks the firepower and range to be effective as the enemy develops
more armored vehicles.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+3 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

20mm Gargoyle Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 15
	17 +2
	19 +2
	21 +2
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100

The only difference between this and the regular version is that the range for
the Gargoyle Chaingun is better.  Still it can give an aircraft a viable means
of attacking ground targets and with large ammo supply it can sustain this for
a long time.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm
bullets add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+2 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

Damage: 23
	26 +3
	29 +3
	32 +3
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200

The only difference between this and the 20 mm Double Chaingun is the range.
Can be an effective weapon at distracting groundbased foes.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add
+3 damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

Ammo: 50 (100)

This weapon is also just called Rocket Launchers.  The UCS actually has several
versions of this depending on whether it's mounted on a building or a unit and
whether the hard point is light or heavy.  This particular version is for dealing
with low level threats.

Level 1 upgraded Rockets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Rockets
add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Rockets add +2 damage
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

	36 +3
	49 +4
Range: 8 (9)
       9 (10) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 76 (150)

A definite improvement over the first version but still lacks punch for handling
heavily armored units.

Level 1 upgraded Rockets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Rockets
add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Rockets add +4 damage
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +10 damage and +1 Range

To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

While the version for mounting on units gets some improvement, the building version
gets a huge increase in firepower-doubling the damage of its previous incarnation.
In fact the building version weapon does a lot more damage than its heavy counterpart
for buildings and is the most damaging light rocket launcher of the 3 factions

Level 1 upgraded Rockets adds +4 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Rockets
add +4 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Rockets add +4 damage

       9 (15) +1
To Air: Yes

The unit version inflicts good damage but has regular range, while the building
version has great range but low damage.

Level 1 upgraded Rockets adds +4 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Rockets
add +4 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Rockets add +4 damage

       9 (15) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

The unit version is now a heavy hitter but the building version is actually weaker
than its light counterpart of the same level.  At this stage of upgrading, the unit
version also develops the ability to use submount weapons.  Note that the building
version cannot use submount weapons

Level 1 upgraded Rockets adds +8 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Rockets

Mainly designed to give the Gargoyle some versatility.  If you intend to use
the Gargoyle for strafing ground targets, then I wouldn't use this weapon as
the Gargoyle has a unique and far better alternative.

add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Rockets add +2 damage

it for battles against enemy aircraft

This is also known as the Heavy Rocket Launcher but this time it is a truly a
heavy weapon.  What's up with the UCS and naming rocket launchers?

Anyways this is the most powerful all-purpose rocket weapon that can be mounted
on a light hard point.  It will prove to be a potent weapon that is effective
against air and ground targets.  After the AA weaponry, this is the best defense
for ground units against air attacks

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system
of 25%.  Upgraded Level 2 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage and a guidance system of
50%.  Upgraded Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system

This is a potent weapon especially when you take into account that it's for light
hard points only.  This weapon can inflict significant damage to air and ground
targets unless protected by heavy armor.

Developed once you research Orca and artillery technology.  This is a powerful and
long range weapon for dealing with enemy gun emplacements and other buildings.
Because of the time it takes to reach a target, it's not effective against moving
targets

Cost: 3000 credits
Time needed: 2 minutes 5 seconds
Hard Points: Special
Type: Projectile
Damage: 700
Range: 40

A lot costlier and time consuming to manufacture, nonetheless this weapon is far
more effective than its predecessor.  You gain this by having researched the Orca
II and artillery technology.

Very similar to the ED version-lots of ammunition and does fairly effective
damage provided you're not up against heavy tanks or gun emplacements.
The main benefit is that the attacks are delivered almost instanteously.
The biggest drawback is the slow rate of fire for this weapon.  No building is
capable of mounting any type of Cannon 105mm

Level 1 upgraded 105mm bullets adds +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2
upgraded 105mm bullets add +3 to the damage.  Level 3 upgraded 105mm bullets
add +4 damage and +1 range.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +10 damage

Its already good damage potential gets an increase and so this could be
quite a dependable weapon for the Tiger and other vehicles capable of using
this weapon.

Level 1 upgraded 105mm bullets adds +4 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2
upgraded 105mm bullets add +5 to the damage.  Level 3 upgraded 105mm bullets

Not as potent as the ED's Heavy Cannon, this is still an effective main weapon
against ground targets.  With ammo upgrades, this weapon also gains significant
range.  This cannon is capable of using submount weapons for more firepower
Keep in mind that no building can mount any type of Cannon 120mm

Level 1 upgraded 120mm bullets adds +4 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2 upgraded
120mm bullets add +5 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 120mm bullets

The 4 barrels on this weapon gives it a slight firepower advantage over the
ED's 120mm Double Cannon.  This can be further improved as this cannon can
use submount weapons.  While it is the most damaging non-artillery/non-energy
cannon around, with four barrels it can go through ammo at an alarming rate.
Also don't forget that this weapon has a slow rate of fire.

Level 1 upgraded 120mm bullets adds +9 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 2
upgraded 120mm bullets add +9 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded

Even with no upgrading, this weapon does large amounts of damage and has
good range.  This should probably be your main gun unless you developed
plasma weapon or strong cannon technology, but even then the grenade launcher
is very useful.  No building can mount a Grenade Launcher of any type

To Air: No
Ammo: 200

This weapon gains a huge increase in the amount of damage inflicted and its
ammo supply is doubled.  This is the weapon of choice for the UCS when assaulting
enemy bases and encampments, though even at with full ammo upgrades this weapon
doesn't quite match the ED's mobile artillery weapons.  With four barrels, this
weapon also goes through ammo quickly

Level 1 upgraded Grenades adds +25 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded Grenades
add +24 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded Grenades add +25 damage
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +74 damage and +1 Range

	600 +200
	800 +200
	1200 +400

This is a powerful weapon that's devastating against ground targets and can be
more devastating than the ED version.

Level 1 upgraded Plasma Bomb adds +200 to the damage, Level 2 upgraded Plasma
Bomb adds +200 to the damage, Level 3 upgraded Plasma Bomb adds +400 to the
damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +800 damage

A newer version of the Bomb Bay, it can carry more bombs

Level 1 upgraded Plasma Bomb adds +200 to the damage, Level 2 upgraded Plasma
Bomb adds +200 to the damage, Level 3 upgraded Plasma Bomb adds +400 to the
damage.  Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +800 damage

Plasma Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
Range: 7 (9)
To Air: No
Ammo: 50

Plasma weaponry will probably be the weapon of choice for the UCS.  The Plasma
Cannon even at the lowest level can inflict heavy damage that bypasses armor,
in fact Plasma weaponry are the most damaging of any energy weapon of the 3
factions.  The Plasma Cannon carries a lot of ammo so it only has to worry about
recharging in very long fights.

The only drawback to the Plasma Cannon is that its attacks doesn't reach the target
as quickly as those of most other energy weapons though it is still very fast in doing so.

Plasma Cannon upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 200
Range: 7 (9)
To Air: No
Ammo: 100

The damage and ammo supply are doubled for this formidable weapon.  It can quickly
down enemy units barring those with very strong shields

AA Plasma Gun
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 400
Range: 10
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 50

Only with full ammo upgrades can the other factions' AA weaponry reach the
the firepower of this weapon.  An extremely effective anti-aircraft weapon, it is
also the only AA weapon with an upgraded version and is energy-based.  Even the
heaviest armor won't save any aircraft targeted by this weapon.  Not as fast as
the ED's AA Gun in speed of delivery but still very fast.  But this is a fairly
big drawback especially against enemy aircraft that aim for dynamic rather than
static attacks

AA Plasma Gun II
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 880
Range: 11
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100

The most heavy hitting anti-aircraft weapon in the game, the damage caused far
outstrips that of any other AA weapon.  A couple of these and enemy aircraft won't
stand a chance even with the strongest shields around.

Gargoyle Plasma Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 45 seconds
Hard Points: Special
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
Range: 7
To Air: No
Ammo: 50

This weapon can only be mounted on a Gargoyle and gives the Gargoyle a very powerful
weapon in strafing runs.  One of the only energy weapons used on aircraft it can be
a very potent threat against any ground unit that lacks weapons that can attack
air targets.

Gargoyle Plasma Cannon m2
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 45 seconds
Hard Points: Special
Type: Energy
Damage: 200
Range: 7
To Air: No
Ammo: 100

The raw firepower, energy-based damage and ample ammo supply on this weapon
makes it fantastic in use against ground targets.

Heavy Plasma Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 200
Range: 9 (11)
To Air: No
Ammo: 50

With the good range and impressive firepower it's an extremely powerful weapon
and is especially useful in destroying armored units and buildings.

Heavy Plasma Cannon upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 400
Range: 9 (11)
To Air: No
Ammo: 100

This newer version gets an impressive doubling in firepower and ammo supply
of an already fearsome weapon.  A few of these and even strongly shielded
enemies go down quickly.

Heavy Plasma Cannon upg.2
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 400
Range: 9
To Air: No
Ammo: 100

Not available for buildings, the only difference between this weapon and the
previous version is that how this weapon can use submount weapons for even
more firepower.

Earthquake Generator
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 16
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 3

The damage is unimpressive to say the least and it doesn't harm enemy units.
But this can be a great weapon for attacking enemy buildings if they're too
heavily defended for air or ground assaults.  It will work when you're underground
and allows you to attack the surface from the tunnels, just click on the ground in
front of you (not the building or you'll try to go back to the surface to launch
a direct attack) and it will attack every building in a radius.  Remember the damage
is really low and it doesn't affect enemy units, so trying to use this in a full
frontal attack is suicide.

Earthquake Generator upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 30
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 5

The damage is still unimpressive but a marked improvement over the original.
A pair of these mounted on a tank with two hard points can really work over
a building.

Antirocket
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Range: 8
Ammo: 50

This acts to fire a small rocket at enemy missiles, hopefully causing them to detonate
harmlessly away from others.  This works great but isn't infallible and so you want more
than one in the vicinity if you're going to use them at all.  Also note that while the
Antimissile is easily mounted on buildings, it can only be used on vehicles that have
weapons with submounts

Transport Hook
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This is what enables a transporter to carry units up.  Can only be used
by Unit Transporters

Repairer
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Point: Special

This item repairs damaged units and buildings at 20 HP per second.  The rate
goes up if more than one repairer are working-with a maximum of 4 repairers
at once.  It can also capture enemy units and buildings that have been disabled
Only the Tiger, Spider, Cargo Salamander, and Shark can carry a repairer

Repairer upg.1
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Point: Special

The Repairer upg.1 repairs damage at 40 HP per second.  Also it can upgrade
units on the field-the manual isn't quite right.   The repairer can indeed upgrade
the chasis of a unit in addition to adding shields and new versions of an existing
weapon.  What it cannot do is change the equipment type of a unit-a repairer suddenly
can't mount a laser cannon for example

Building Grabber
Cost: 600 credits
Time Needed: 10 seconds
Hard Points: Light

Gives you quick ability to capture enemy buildings as you don't need to ionize
them first.  For the UCS, this is the first step in getting a chance to capture
enemy units provided that the right circumstances occur.

Radar
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light

Unfortunately it's not available for buildings, so you'll have to mount it on a unit.
The radar enables the unit to detect enemy units that have been cloaked with stealth
technology.  Radar is available for production once Shadow Generator technology has
been researched.

Shadow Generator I
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light

This is the earliest level of Shadow Generator that can be placed on a unit, it cloaks
the unit and those nearby in shadows rendering them invisible provided that their lights
aren't on.  It's not as powerful as the building version at the same level development

Shadow Generator II
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light

This version improves on the range of the previous version and is the final version
for buildings.

Shadow Generator III
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light

This version has a range that is as far as that of the best building version, you only
need a few of these to cover an entire army.

2.3 ********UNITED CIVILIZED STATES CHASSIS********
	*Some hard points can hold unusual equipment or have limited equipment

Tiger
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Light

It's no quicker than a heavy tank type and it's supposed to be light!  But it does have
decent toughness considering its size (the manual got it wrong, the Tiger is quite
resistant against projectile weapons but falls quickly to energy weapons).  Also the
ability to mount a grenade launcher or plasma cannon gives this unit an early firepower
advantage and its ability to use a repairer can make it an early repair unit.  Also it's
cheaper than any other light attack units save the LC Lunar.

Keep in mind that it is essentially a light tank and cannot hold up against heavier units.
As well it cannot mount any shields and this never improves.

Tiger I
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 270
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Light

The toughness and speed goes up, it's still neither fast nor incredibly tough.  Still it
can dominate most other light attack units-just don't expect to come out unscathed.

Tiger II
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

While the speed and toughness goes up again, don't count on it for victory in one on one
fights except against most other light attack units.  With its low cost, the main use
would be to drum up a legion of cheap tanks and swarm the enemy.

Panther
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This is the heavy tank of UCS.  Considering the weapons it can field, its firepower
can do quite nicely against the heavy tanks of the other factions.

Panther I
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1050
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Panther gets faster and quite a ways tougher.  Considering how
much armor it has, the boost in toughness can prove to be quite significant.
It's strong enough to dominate most fights and fast enough to move in and
out of  trouble spots.

Panther II
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1200
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Panther again gets faster and tougher.  All things considered,
if Jaguars are too expensive, the Panther II makes a nice alternative
with its decent speed and ability to withstand damage.

Jaguar
Cost: 1300 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 15 seconds
HP: 1300
Armor: 75%
Speed: 14
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     1 Light

The Jaguar is the super-heavy tank of the UCS and while it's fantastic unit it
suffers in comparison to those of the other factions.  It's chassis costs more
and takes longer to build than the other super-heavy tank types.  Not only that
but with only one heavy hard point it has significantly less firepower its
counterparts.  You'll have to make some smart equipment choices if you want to
offset this weak spot.

Jaguar I
Cost: 1300 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 15 seconds
HP: 1500
Armor: 75%
Speed: 14
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     1 Light

This version of the Jaguar gains some more toughness.  Considering how much
armor the Jaguar has, the toughness boost can really be a keeper in increasing
the Jaguar's survival rate.  Unless you have access to Grizzlies, this the UCS
unit of choice in battle.

Minelayer
Cost: 500 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 18
Ammo: 10
Hard Points: 1 Light

This is the minelayer for the UCS and can not only lay mines but also detect them
as well.  It has a good amount of toughness and some armor and can carry all variety
of light weapons into battle barring the AA plasma gun.  It can hold its own in a
fight but you'll want to send an escort with it as it can't initiate attacks on its own

Minelayer II
Cost: 570 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 675
Armor: 50%
Speed: 19
Ammo: 20
Hard Points: 1 Light

This version of the minelayer gains more toughness, armor and speed.  This pushes
the toughness and armor to respectable levels.  The improvements should greatly
increase its survivability and because of its strong weapon choices it's superior
to the ED's ZT 210 Minelayer but you still want some escort in case a fight breaks out.
It's supply of mines are also doubled.

Spider
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 0
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Light

This is one of the 'jack of all trades' units of the UCS, unfortunately it doesn't
hold up too well in combat as it lacks armor.  If you've played ED, the Spider is
essentially the same as the Taiga but capable of being a lot tougher.

Spider I
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 525
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

An increase in toughness and speed, still it's not that good of a unit to take to a fight

Spider II
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 40 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Light

There's a further increase in toughness, but I'd still leery of bringing it into a fight.
By the time you reach this level of development, your foes will probably have access to
heavy tanks and weapons which will easily decimate a Spider.

Cargo Salamander
Cost: 1500 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 15 seconds
HP: 1500
Armor: 75%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 1 Light

This is a tough unit and the other 'jack of all trades'.  With its heavy armor and
impressive toughness, this unit can last quite awhile in a fight.  In fact it's the only
unit capable of carrying an AA Plasma Gun and so you'll want to have some along at least
for that purpose.  The two big drawbacks with the Cargo Salamander is that it lacks speed
and cannot use shields, which makes it weak in combat against units using energy weapons.

Shark
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 450
Armor: 50%
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 1 Light

This is the light gunboat of the UCS.  It's good for patrolling and scouting but
lacks the firepower to really the press the enemy

Shark II
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 550
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Light

This version of the Shark has more toughness and speed.  This helps it get out
alive whenever it gets into firefights that are well beyond its abilities to contain,
which is pretty often.

Hydra
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1400
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Hydra is battlecruiser of the UCS and has plenty of toughness and armor.
While it packs some heavy firepower, at this stage it's not strong enough to really gain
naval dominance especially against the ED Leviathan and should be relegated to bombarding
targets on dry land from long range and

Hydra II
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1600
Armor: 75%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     1 Light

With an extra light hard point, more speed and toughness, the Hydra II is certainly a
big improvement.  Unfortunately it still doesn't match up against the Leviathan yet.

Hydra III
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1800
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
	     2 Light

With a further increase to toughness and an additional light hard point, the Hydra III
is the strongest naval vessel of any faction.  Use it to establish dominance in the water.

Orca
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 1 Special

The Orca can fire Plasma Warheads at distant targets while safely hidden under
water.  Still watch out for enemy units especially when they have radar units or
something similar.

Orca II
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1000
Armor: 50%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 1 Special

The improved Orca has more toughness and speed.  In addition it can use the
superior Plasma Warheads upg.1

Mammoth
Cost: 800 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
HP: 1800
Armor: 0
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 0

This is the construction vehicle for the UCS.  It can only use light shield projectors.

Harvester
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 0

The Harvester is the unit that collects resources from the field and delivers them to the
refinery for processing

Harvester II
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 0

The Harvester gains more toughness, more speed and is well armored.  This greatly increases
its chances of survival during mining runs

Harvester III
Harvester
Cost: 700 credits
Time needed: 20 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 0

The Harvester gets even more toughness and speed.  It has also been augmented
with heavy armor.  Few things can readily destroy a retreating Harvester once it
reaches this stage.

Harvester IV
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 0

This Harvester is unarmored and lacks the speed and toughness of the earlier versions,
however it can now fly

Harvester V
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 0

This Harvester can not only fly but has increased toughness and good armor.  There'll be
little threat from ground-based attackers unless you're in the process of mining.

Harvester VI
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 0

This Harvester gains even more toughness and its armor has been upgraded to heavy levels.
Provided that you can make a quick retreat, there shouldn't be much threat to this unit at all.

Albatross
Cost: Special
Time needed: Special
HP: 1500
Armor: 75%
Speed: Special
Hard Points: 0

The Albatross is the transporter that ferries your troops between your main base, your subsidiary
bases and the mission site.  You always start with one and can move it between landing zones.
Up to 15 units and 5000 credits can be carried at one time.

Unit Transporter
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 550
Armor: 50%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: Special

Extremely fast and well armored, the Unit Transporter can usually deliver ground units safely or
it can pick up stationary enemy units to drop to their deaths.

Condor
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 0
Speed: 32
Hard Points: 0

The supply ship of the UCS, it's equivalent to everyone else's.   It's fast and very durable
unfortunately it has no armor so anti-aircraft fire will make short work of it.  Without an
adequate number of Condors and aerial supply depots, you won't have enough ammo to sustain
a long fight.

Gargoyle
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The light attack fighter of the UCS, it is very expensive.  Also at this stage, it cannot mount
any shield projectors though this shouldn't be much of a problem.  The big concern is just how
much the Gargoyle costs

The most exceptional thing about the Gargoyle is the ability to use Gargoyle Plasma Cannons which
allows it inflict heavy damage against ground targets, so the Gargoyle can be worth its cost

Gargoyle II
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 270
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Gargoyle gains some much needed toughness and can mount a light shield
projector.  The shields are unimportant but the increased toughness should
enable the Gargoyle II to stay in a fight for extended periods of time and
make a successful retreat when things get too hot.

Gargoyle III
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Gargoyle gains additional toughness which should make the Gargoyle tough
enough to withstand limited amounts of anti-aircraft fire.  When armed with plasma cannons,
this version of the Gargoyle can almost rival a bomber in terms of effectiveness against
ground targets.

Bat
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 375
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Bat does boast the same level of firepower as the Dragon but it lacks the
toughness and armor to be really effective on bombing runs.   It's not particularly
impressive and you'll probably be building these only if the Dragon is unavailable or
can't afford it.  In fact the Bat should probably be relegated to fighter purposes or
harassing ground targets that are out in the open

Bat II
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 450
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This version of the Bat gains some more toughness and while this is a good thing, it still
lacks the toughness and armor to effectively break through enemy lines.  I'd say keep it
as a fighter or for harassing ground targets that lack a strong air defense.

Dragon
Cost: 1500 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 600
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This is the heavy bomber of the UCS, it's very tough, heavily armored,
can field some heavy firepower and is just as fast as the Bat.  Too
bad the cost of this unit can be prohibitive

Dragon II
Cost: 1500 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This version of the Dragon has improved toughness and should be able
to weather most damage before getting into a bombing run.

extremely tough and heavily armored it has no defensive systems
whatsoever.

Aerial Supply Depot

Headquarters
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 2 Light

The Headquarters can automate your base defense, the construction of units, upgrading of
building weapons and research paths.  It takes one Headquarters for each assignment.
Frailer than the Headquarters of other factions, UCS Headquarters can protect itself
fairly well with its two hard points.

However I find only the automation of your base defense to be useful.  The computer is
notorious for making poor choices in other areas.  With base defense though, it'll open
fire at incoming foes from maximum range.

The Tunnel Entrance is the point of entry where units can go underground through a
series of tunnels.

Walls
Resource Cost: 10 credits

Erects a strong stone wall that can take quite a bit of punishment without collapsing

Narrow Bridge
Resource Cost: 50 credits

Forms a bridge that is one square in width

Wide Bridge
Resource Cost: 50 credits

Forms a bridge that is 2 squares in width.

Small Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 200 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 350
Armor: 50%
Hard Points: 1 Light

A short defensive structure that can defend itself from attack with its weapon.
Unfortunately it is sorely lacking in firepower and toughness.  The biggest advantage
is that the Small Tower does not cost energy.

Large Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 1800
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

This is a very strong defensive structure with lots of toughness, heavy armor and a
powerful weapon.   Its height enables it to shoot clearly over most buildings

Heavy Tower
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 750 credits
Energy Cost: 20 power
HP: 1350
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 1 Heavy
        	 2 Light

Not as tall or tough as the Large Tower, the Heavy Tower more than makes up for it
by carrying a lot of firepower.  The Heavy Tower can handle almost any threat provided
it gets support

Fortress
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 2000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 4000
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 2 Heavy
        	 2 Light

This is probably the most powerful of all base defenses and it can be more than a match
for most forces especially when placed in numbers.  Its sheer toughness, strong armor,
heavy firepower and relatively low energy cost makes this the most desirable of the
base defenses.  It's even short enough that most buildings can fire over it.  The only
drawback is that it can get pretty pricey.

Artillery
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 5000 credits
Energy Cost: 100 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Type: Projectile
Damage: 500
Range: 70
Ammo: 3
Hard Points: 0

The longest ranged artillery building of the 3 factions.  This is fantastic
for bombarding targets from safe distances and also makes a powerful base
defense set to fire at will and in a proper line formation.  Just keep in mind
to avoid friendly fire

Plasma Control Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 10000 credits
Energy Cost: 400 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

This weapon of mass destruction is probably the most efficient in terms of power
and cost.  It can produce up to 4 Plasma Cannons

Plasma Cannon
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 15000 credits
Energy Cost: 400 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Type: Energy
Damage: 4000
Range: 300
Hard Points: 0

This facility fires extremely devastating bolts of plasma.  The plasma bolts are extremely
effective against heavily armored but unshielded targets, however it less so against targets
with shields


3.0				THE LUNAR CORPORATION

	They're the good guys though they have their fair share of skeletons in the closet.
The manual says they're the most high tech of all the factions and they certainly are unique

Pros
-The LC has the unique ability to plunk buildings down almost anywhere without the aid of
construction vehicles of any kind.

-To top it off, their transmission of power goes everywhere so no need to worry about a
building being out of range of a power source.

-Their units tend to be cheaper and faster to produce than anyone else's, once their production
gets going they can readily get a numbers advantage over their foes.

-Additionally their units all have hovering ability if not outright flight, tend to be faster
than their counterparts in other factions and regenerate.  Their early units are also quite
strong plus some of them have rather unique
attributes

-They have the strongest shield projectors in the game and all of the units can carry one.

-They are the only faction that is capable of regeneration and speeding up shield recovery.

-Their energy weapons give them excellent close combat ability as well as lots of disruption
potential.  They have some of the best rocket launchers of the 3 factions

-Finally they have the strongest air force when it comes to air superiority.

Cons
-Typically their units are not quite as tough as those of their opposition, though this
difference isn't spectacular and there are exceptions.

-Where the LC really get hosed is in providing an adequate supply of power.  During night
time or heavy cloud cover, the LC will get little or any power and will be running on batteries
or the inefficient Xyrex power plant.

-Another weak spot is that their weapons tend to do less damage than their foes and have a
severe lack of effective projectile weapons outside of rockets and heavy rockets.  The damage
they inflict from aerial bombing or artillery fire is pretty unimpressive save for the Crion.

-They have no stealth or repairer technology and their main civilian support unit is a very fragile.
They're a bit slow to get going and it takes awhile to get used their unconventional ways but
once they're on track, watch out!!!

3.2 ********LUNAR CORPORATION EQUIPMENT********
*Numbers in brackets refer to the building version

Banner
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 0
Hard Points: Light

Universal to all factions, the banner gives your units something to rally around and so
gives the units and buildings in range 2 experience ranks.

20mm Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 15
	17 +2
	19 +2
	21 +2
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100 (200)

Chainguns are practically useless against anything with armor more than 25%.  It's a
weapon that can be effective in the early stages but later on even with full weapon
and ammo upgrades it becomes something of a novelty with its low damage and short range.

The main benefit of a Chaingun is its high ammo supply, quick delivery and ability to
shoot targets in the air-it has a high rate of fire but so do many other weapon types

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add +2 damage
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

20mm Double Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 23
	26 +3
	29 +3
	32 +3
Range: 6 (8)
       7 (9) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200 (400)

The 20mm Chaingun upgrades to the 20mm Double Chainguns.  The Double Chaingun has slightly
more damage than unmodified Rocket Launchers and has superior damage improvement over the
ordinary Chaingun when using upgraded bullets.  While they go through bullets faster due
to the dual barrels, the enlarged magazine more than covers the increased ammunition needs.
Unfortunately this weapon lacks the firepower and range to be effective as the enemy develops
more armored vehicles. However I sometimes like to keep a couple of Fat Girls with only
20mm Double Chainguns to harass the enemy aircraft and civilian units.  With 4 light hardpoints,
an all chaingun Fat Girl can be pretty potent and is especially effective against unarmored
units and buildings.


Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add +3 damage.
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

20mm Air Chaingun
Cost: 200 credits

Damage: 15
	17 +2
	19 +2
	21 +2
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 100

The only difference between this and the regular version is that the range for the
Air Chaingun is better and takes to longer to make.  Still it can give an aircraft a
viable means of attacking ground targets and with large ammo supply it can sustain
this for a long time.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +2 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +2 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add +2 damage
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +6 damage and +1 Range

Damage: 23
	26 +3
	29 +3
	32 +3
Range: 7
       8 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 200

The only difference between this and the 20 mm Double Chaingun is the range and
time needed to make this.  Can be an effective weapon at distracting groundbased foes.

Level 1 upgraded 20mm bullets adds +3 to the damage.  Level 2 upgraded 20mm bullets
add +3 to the damage and +1 range.  Level 3 upgraded 20mm bullets add +3 damage.
Having all 3 levels of upgrade gives +9 damage and +1 Range

The LC Rocket Launcher is one of the more damaging of any factions' rocket launchers.
Initially isn't too impressive but it certainly is useful even at this stage.  The range
is decent and it has the ability to shoot targets in the air.

The damage isn't much better at inflicting damage than a 20mm Chaingun.  Also it has a
high rate of fire but low ammo count and a habit to fire way more rockets than necessary
so count on regular calls for re-supply.  Until a rocket launcher has been given upgraded
rockets, all rockets used are dumb-fires.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +2 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.  Upgraded
Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +2 damage, increases the guidance system  to 50% and
increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +2 damage-so having
all the Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher will give you +6 damage, +1 range and 100%
guidance

Rocket Launcher upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 36
	40 +4
	43 +3
	47 +4
Range: 8 (10)
       9 (11) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 80 (150)

The Rocket Launcher upg.1 uses a twin launcher to deliver heavier attacks than the original system.
This means that each shot actually uses up 2 rockets rather than 1,However the Rocket Launcher upg.1
comes with 20 more missiles than the previous version and  with the higher damage inflicted, this is
more than worth it.  Also note that Rocket Launcher upg.1 has significantly better damage bonuses for
upgraded rockets.

The Rocket Launcher upg.1 can pose significant threat to lightly armored ground vehicles
and aircraft however its usefulness goes down dramatically against armored foes.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +4 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +3 damage, increases the guidance system to 50% and
increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +4 damage-so having all the
Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher upg.1 will give you +11 damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

Rocket Launcher upg.2
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 44
	48 +4
	53 +5
	57 +4
Range: 8 (10)
       9 (11) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 110 (200)

Rocket Launcher upg.2 manages to squeeze in a fair amount more damage than
their upg.1 counterparts and has added a lot more ammo.  The damage from the LC
version is somewhat better than most of the rocket launchers of the other factions.
Keep in mind that even this level of Rocket Launcher doesn't pack enough damage
to be much of a threat against heavy bombers and tank-like units.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +4 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +5 damage, increases the guidance system
To 50% and increasing range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +4
damage-so having all the Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher upg.2 will give you +13
Damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

AA Rocket Launcher
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Projectile
Damage: 100 (200)
	130 +30 (260+60)
	160 +30 (320 +60)
	200 +40 (400 +80)
Range: 8 (10)
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 20 (50)

This would be the best air defense available to the LC, unfortunately it's probably the
least effective of any faction's AA weaponry.  It lacks the raw damage and fast speed
in delivery of the UCS's AA Plasma Cannon or the near instantaneous speed of delivery
in the AA gun of the ED, but at least it does gain the tracking ability of its guided rockets
if you bothered to research upgraded rockets.  In my opinion it's the worst of the
anti-aircraft weapons but it's still going to be very useful

The AA Rocket Launcher is far more effective in the building version than when mounted
on the Super Fighter.  In fact when mounted on the Super Fighter, the AA Rocket Launcher is
by far the weakest of the AA weapons.  Since none of the ground vehicles can carry the AA Rocket
Launcher, the LC are at a disadvantage when dealing with airborne threats to ground units.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +30 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.
Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +30 damage, increases the guidance system to 50%.
Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +40 damage-so having all the Rocket upgrades for
a Rocket Launcher upg.2 will give you +100 Damage and 100% guidance

For the building version-Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +60 damage as well as a guidance system of
25%.  Upgraded Level 2 Rocket gives an additional +60 damage, increases the guidance system to 50%
and increasing range by+1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +80 damage-so having all
the Rocket upgrades for a Rocket Launcher upg.2 will give you +200 Damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

	26 +2
Range: 8
       9 +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 20

The Air Rocket Launcher is mainly designed to allow aircraft to fire guided rockets at
foes in the air or ground.  The damage isn't much better at inflicting damage than a 20mm
Air Chaingun and same can be said of the range.  Also it has a high rate of fire but a
ridiculously low ammo count, uses 2 rockets at a time and has a habit of firing way more
rockets than necessary, so count on regular calls for re-supply.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +2 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.  Upgraded Level 2
Rocket gives an additional +2 damage, increases the guidance system  to 50% and increasing range
by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +2 damage-so having all the Rocket upgrades
for a Rocket Launcher will give you +6 damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

Range: 8
       9 +1
To Air: Yes
	Ammo: 40

With a much heavier damage, this rocket system can be quite the threat from the skies.
Ammuntion is still a concern as this weapon fires 4 rockets at a time which negates the
increased magazine.

Upgraded Level 1 Rocket gives +4 damage as well as a guidance system of 25%.  Upgraded Level 2
Rocket gives an additional +4 damage, increases the guidance system  to 50% and increasing
range by +1.  Upgraded Level 3 Rocket gives an additional +4 damage-so having all the Rocket
upgrades for a Rocket Launcher will give you +12 damage, +1 range and 100% guidance

Heavy Rocket Launcher

       12 (15) +1
To Air: Yes
Ammo: 40 (100)

Next to the AA Rocket Launcher, this is the bane of aircrafts for the LC and has significant range.
However the first version of the Heavy Rocket Launcher doesn't inflict that much damage yet and
continues its smaller relatives' weak spot regarding ammo.  This is also the strongest projectile
weapon type for the LC after their Artillery which tells you something about the LC's weakness
in the ballistics department.  Note that the building version does less damage than the unit's-in
fact the LC's unit version of the Heavy Rocket Launcher does the most damage of any factions' heavy
rocket launcher, which is a good thing considering that the LC lacks cannon or grenade
launcher technology.

Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance system  of 25%.  Upgraded Level
2 Heavy Rocket gives +4 damage and a guidance system of 50%.  Upgraded Level 3 Heavy Rocket gives +5
damage, +1 Range and a guidance system of 100%.  Having all 3 levels gives +13 damage, +2 Range and
guidance 100%

For the building version-Upgraded Level 1 Heavy Rockets gives +4 damage, +1 Range and a guidance

The Heavy Rocket Launcher can really land a whallop.  Construct some Crushers
carrying these and you got quite the anti-air unit.  It can be a viable bombardment
weapon if you haven't developed Artillery or Plasma Artillery.

Electro-Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 40
Range: 6 (7)
To Air: No
Ammo: 10

The first energy weapon available to the LC, the range isn't impressive and neither
is the amount of shoots it can take before needing to recharge.  However it shoots
too quickly to easily avoid, can be quite damaging to any ground vehicle that lacks
adequate shielding and if it inflicts enough damage on an unshielded vehicle, it has
a chance to ionize them.  Against buildings, this ionization effect happens fairly often
and so this makes a fairly good weapon against enemy fortifications.  For the most
part though just think of them as weaker versions of ED's lasers but are effective
against buildings and causes actual physical damage.

Electro-Cannon upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 60
Range: 6 (7)
To Air: No
Ammo: 10

There's only one change from the previous version but it's a potent one.
The Electro-Cannon upg.1 does an impressive 50% more damage than its
predecessor.  Don't underestimate a unit armed with these.

Heavy Electro-Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 55 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
Range: 8 (10)
To Air: No
Ammo: 10

Not only does this weapon do significant damage but it also can mount a subweapon.
Unfortunately it's the only LC weapon that can mount subweapons.  You're also not
likely to see an ionization effect on units from this weapon as the level of damage it
inflicts tends to just blast its targets into smithereens before you can shock them.

Heavy Electro-Cannon up.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 55 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 146
Range: 8 (10)
To Air: No
Ammo: 10

An already fearsome weapon just became a lot meaner.  This weapon is great
for dealing with strong units and buildings, the only downside is that it
doesn't match up with lasers or plasma weapons in blasting through shields

Plasma Beam
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Special
Type: Energy
Damage: 76
Range: 7
To Air: No
Ammo: 5

This is the only weapon useable by the New Hope and in turn it can only be mounted
on a New Hope.  It's very damaging by the standards of light energy weapons and in
numbers can pose significant threat during hit and run attacks.  Don't be surprised if
you see group of 2 or 3 New Hopes destroy a shielded tank of the heaviest type in a
short period of time.  Finally the plasma beam can also ionize enemy units.

Unfortunately the plasma beam can only take a few shots before needing a recharge
and it has a slow rate of fire.  The turret on this weapon also turns slowly so watch
out for that.

Sonic Cannon
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 35 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 60
To Air: No
Range: 4 (7)
Ammo: 5

This energy weapon has lousy range but it's deadly in a close quarter fight.  Not only does
it fire in a radius but the damage does not harm your own LC units.

Sonic Cannon upg.1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 35 seconds
Hard Points: Light
Type: Energy
Damage: 60
To Air: No
Range: 4 (7)
Ammo: 5

On first viewing it seems as if nothing improved but actually the recharge rate went down
by a fair margin

Heavy Sonic Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 60 (100)
To Air: No
Range: 5 (8)
Ammo: 10

No increase in damage except for the building version makes this a somewhat mediocre
weapon.  You can largely get the same effect by just submounting some ordinary sonic
cannons on a vehicle.  The building version on the other hand can provide a lot of threat
value especially when over lapping with other similarly armed buildings.

Heavy Sonic Cannon upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 60 (240)
To Air: No
Range: 5 (8)
Ammo: 10

The building version gains a huge increase in damage and can be devastating against ground units.
Both the unit and building version feature increased recharge rates.  Also keep in mind that only
by researching through Heavy Sonic Cannons can you develop the Plasma Artillery

Plasma Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed:
Hard Points: Special
Type: Energy (special)
Damage: 1000
Range: 20
To Air: No
Ammo: 1

This energy weapon is unique to the LC's Crion.  Not only does it have very long range and does
phenomenal damage that puts all other artillery pieces to shame but the damage it inflicts bypass
ARMOR AND SHIELDS!!!!!!!!!!  To top it off it's an energy weapon so it can constantly bombard the
enemy without having to call for more ammo.  The only drawback is that it has the shortest range
of any artillery weapon.  This is truly a ferocious weapon

Air Sonic Cannon
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 6

This is the bomb bay of the LC essentially.  True the damage doesn't close to
approaching that of the other factions but this is extremely deadly nonetheless.
It not only bypasses armor but it doesn't harm friendly LC units and so can be used
for base defense as well as assaults where friendlies are in the region.

Air Sonic Cannon upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 30 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 100
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 6

It takes even longer to produce then before but at least this weapon has a faster
recharging rate

Earthquake Generator
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 16
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 3

The damage is unimpressive to say the least and doesn't harm enemy units.  But
this can be a great weapon for attacking enemy buildings if they're too heavily
defended for air or ground assaults.  It will work when you're underground and
allows you to attack the surface from the tunnels, just click on the ground in front
of you (not the building or you'll try to go back to the surface to launch a direct attack)
and it will attack every building in a radius.  Remember the damage is really low and
it doesn't affect enemy units, so trying to use this in a full frontal attack is suicide.

Earthquake Generator upg.1
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 1 minute 40 seconds
Hard Points: Heavy
Type: Energy
Damage: 30
To Air: No
Range: 5
Ammo: 5

The damage is still unimpressive but a marked improvement over the original.  A pair
of these mounted on a tank with two hard points can really work over a building.

Antimissile
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 5 seconds
Range: 8
Ammo: 50
Hard Points: Light

This acts to fire a small rocket at enemy missiles, hopefully causing them to detonate
harmlessly away from others.  This works great but isn't infallible and so you want more
than one in the vicinity if you're going to use them at all.  Also note that while the
Antimissile is easily mounted on buildings, it can only be used on vehicles that have
weapons with submounts

Detector m1
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed:
Hard Points: Special

Aargh, why is something so essential such as the Detector only available on the Phobos?
The Detector is the only way for the LC to detect stealth units and in addition also greatly
expands the sight radius of the Phobos it's mounted on.  Unfortunately no building or other
unit can use this so you'll need to produce a fair quantity of these.  Actually the
LC start off with this without needing any research.

Detector m2
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed:
Hard Points: Special

This is simply an upgraded version with a larger sight radius than the original.  Makes
for an excellent early warning system since it covers a very large radius

Regenerator m1
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

LC buildings and units regenerate at rate of 1 HP per second.  The regenerator
increases the healing rate to 2 HP per second.  The biggest advantage is that
the regenerator heals in a fairly large radius including units flying in the air.
Unfortunately it lacks the range of options available to the repairer and having
more than one in an area doesn't speed up regeneration.  Also it can only be
mounted on a Phobos

Regenerator m2
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

This increases regeneration to 3 HP per second

Regenerator m3
Cost: 200 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

This increases regeneration to 4 HP per second

Building Grabber
Cost: 600 credits
Time Needed: 10 seconds
Hard Points: Light

Gives you quick ability to capture enemy buildings as you don't need to ionize them first.
The Building Grabber is the only way the LC can capture something from the enemy.
The LC can only capture buildings not units as they lack repairer technology.

Shield Recharger m1
Cost: 200 credits
Time Needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

An advantage unique to the LC, where normally a shield recharges at 2 point per second,
the shield recharger increases this to 3 points per second

Shield Recharger m2
Cost: 200 credits
Time Needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

Increases recharge rate to 4 points per second which can be significant

Shield Recharger m3
Cost: 200 credits
Time Needed: 50 seconds
Hard Points: Special

Increases recharge rate to an excellent 6 points per second.  Having one of these
and the top of the line shields means you'll have little to fear from energy weapons

Transport Hook
Cost: 100 credits
Time Needed: 5 seconds
Hard Points: Special

This is what enables a transporter to carry units up.  Can only be used
by Unit Transporters

Power Shield Generator 1000 PSU
Cost: 100 credits

Significantly stronger than the light shield generators of the other factions

Power Shield Generator 1500 PSU
Cost: 200 credits

Still significantly stronger than the medium shield generators of the other
factions, though the difference isn't as great a s before

Power Shield Generator 2000 PSU
Cost: 400 credits

The most powerful shields in the game though the difference isn't so pronounced
against other factions' heavy generators when compared to the other LC generators

3.3 ********LUNAR CORPORATION CHASSIS********

    *Some hard points can hold unusual equipment or have limited
    equipment

Lunar m1
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 0
Speed: 28
Hard Points: 1 Light

It's certainly fast and great for scouting but with a single light hard point
and no armor at all, this vehicle is going to be cannonfodder in combat.
A further drawback is that it can only mount light shields and this does not
improve with later models.  Good thing it's so cheap and fast to produce

Lunar m2
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 270
Armor: 0
Speed: 32
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Lunar m2 gains more toughness and speed, but it's still going to be
a loser in a fight.   Don't count on it defeating anything that's built
for combat except another Lunar.

Lunar m3
Cost: 100 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 0
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Lunar m3 becomes tougher and gains even more speed.  It makes for
a fantastic scout as it easily outraces enemy units if it's been spotted.
It should be tough enough to be a credible threat against enemy light tanks
if you can swarm them in significant numbers, especially if you outfit the Lunar
with an electro-cannon.

Moon m1
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 50%
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 1 Light

Frankly I'd pick the Moon over the Lunar any day.  The Moon m1
is inexpensive, just as tough as a Lunar m3, can mount any shield,
it's got good armor and is still very fast despite being heavier than
the Lunar.  But with only a single light hard point, don't expect it to
crush tanks with a couple of shots.

Moon m2
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 400
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Light

Moon m2 has increased toughness and speed and can survive quite
a bit of skirmishing.  The Moon series are probably the best of
the light tank varieties.

Moon m3
Cost: 300 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 500
Armor 50%
Speed: 28
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Moon m3 is now quite sturdy and fast enough to avoid all but the
fastest vehicles.  It should be more than a match for any other light tanks
depending on what equipment they've been outfitted with.

Crater m1
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

While this is a powerful unit, in relation to the heavy tanks of other factions
it's the weakest and the only advantage it has over them is the standard LC ability
to hover.  Initially it's faster than the Panther or Kruschev but later versions of
those two heavy tanks will have them matching the Crater's speed.  The only reason to
pick the Crater over the Crusher is that only the most advanced versions of the
Crusher can use the best shield projectors.

Crater m2
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 900
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Crater m2 becomes tougher and while it's a tough nut to crack it doesn't hold
up well against other enemy heavy tanks unless you have the numerical advantage

Crater m3
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1050
Armor: 75%
Speed: 19
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Crater m3 is pretty disappointing as it's only slightly faster the Crusher m3 and
that's it.  There's not too much point in researching this vehicle except that it is the
only way to research the New Hope.

Crusher m1
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1100
Armor: 75%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 2 Heavy

The Crusher lacks the toughness of the other factions' super-heavy tanks but it certainly
Is faster and is still a formidable unit.  Ignore what it says in the manual, not only does
the Crusher have more weapons than a Crater but it is tougher as well.  Since they have the
same price and construction time there's little real reason you should make the Crater.
The only disadvantage compared to the Crater is that the Crusher m1 can only mount up to
a medium shield generator and has a slower speed.

Crusher m2
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1200
Armor: 75%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 2 Heavy

The only improvement made is that the Crusher m2 is tougher than the original.
However this boost in toughness can go a ways in increasing the survival rate of
the Crusher and besides you'll want to research this so you can research the next
level of Crusher upgrade.

Crusher m3
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 1300
Armor: 75%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 2 Heavy

Not much tougher than a Kruschev or Panther but it's almost as fast.  The
Crusher m3 not only has improved toughness and speed but it can now mount
the most powerful shield generator as well, making it one of the best units in the
game.  Once you develop this tank there's no reason to go with the Crater.

New Hope
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
HP: 120
Armor: 75%
Speed: 28
Hard Points: Special

On the surface this experimental vehicle looks very unimpressive but it can be
surprisingly effective in a support/scouting role.  First while the toughness level
is abysmal, the heavy armor on the New Hope can reduce all but deadliest
projectile damage to survivable levels.  The New Hope also regenerates at
an incredible 7 HP per second so that it can go from almost death to full health in
only a short time.  Unfortunately the New Hope can only mount the weakest shield
projectors and so it doesn't stand up very well against intensive energy attacks

The plasma beam mounted on the New Hope provides a nice level of firepower
for a light weapon and the New Hope is one of the fastest vehicles in the game,
giving the New Hope fairly impressive hit and run abilities.  I've had a New Hope
single-handedly destroy an Ural carrying artillery.

Crion
Cost: 1200 credits
Time needed:
HP: 750
Armor: 0
Speed: 15
Hard Points: Special

The Crion is essentially the LC's mobile artillery unit.  The Crion can only mount the
Plasma Cannon and in turn is the only thing that can mount it.  It's slow, lacks armor
and can only mount up to a Power Shield Generator 1500 PSU but it's one of the best
units in the game due to the incredible devastation and very long range of its Plasma
Cannon.  And for only a total of 1800 credits (chassis plus weapon), it comes at a
fairly cheap price.  Note that it can only gained by developing the Plasma Artillery
technology.

Fat Girl c2
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 45 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 16
Hard Points: 2 Light

What happened to c1?  Anyways the Fat Girl is the combat capable civilian vehicle
of the LC.  Actually it's more geared towards combat than anything.  With moderate armor,
good toughness and 2 light hard points it can hold its own in a fight though
it is a slowpoke.  Finally it has a better than normal rate of regeneration, it regains
3 HP per second.

Fat Girl c3
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 45 seconds
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 17
Hard Points: 3 Light

The Fat Girl c3 isn't an improvement in anything but firepower and speed.  With 3 light
hard points, it possesses a fairly impressive array of firepower though.  It should prove
to be a tough combatant though it definitely dishes out better than it receives.

Fat Girl c4
Cost: 600 credits
Time needed: 45 seconds
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 18
Hard Points: 4 Light

The Fat Girl c4 has gained another hard point, good armor, more toughness and speed.
The Fat Girl c4 can utterly pound any light tank and depending on the weapons it
carries, it can pose significant threat to heavy tanks.  The only drawback is that it has
difficulty dealing with heavy bombers since it can't carry AA or heavy rocket launchers

Tunnel Gouger
Cost: 800 credits
Time needed: 50 seconds
HP: 1800
Armor: 0
Speed: 21
Hard Points: 0

The Tunnel Gouger serves only to form tunnels and has no offensive capability.  It
also can only mount a light shield generator and has no armor, however it has plenty
of health and good speed so it show be able to run away safely for the most part.

Meteor
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 180
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

It cannot mount any shields, it's got little in the way of toughness or armor and it lacks
the firepower to be anything more than an annoyance.   But it certainly is fast

Meteor m2
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 240
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Meteor m2 gets a bit tougher but still doesn't stand up well to punishment

Meteor m3
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 30 seconds
HP: 300
Armor: 25%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Meteor m3 just might pull through in a pinch but it's still a weak craft and would
rely on swarming tactics to be a threat.  It can mount a light shield projector

Super Fighter m1
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Speed: 32
Hard Points: 2 Light

It's the only LC unit capable of mounting the AA Rocket Launcher and with 2 hard points
it can easily rip enemy aircraft out of the skies and can provide support to ground units.
It can use all types of shields, allowing it to withstand UCS AA Plasma Guns

While tough and fast, the Super Fighter lacks armor and so is very vulnerable to anti-aircraft
fire.  Also unless both hard points are used for the AA Rocket Launchers, the
Super Fighter's air superiority goes down dramatically.

Super Fighter m2
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 0
Speed: 32
Hard Points: 2 Light

The Super Fighter m2 becomes as tough as the toughest heavy bomber.  Unfortunately
it still doesn't have any armor.  Still the combination of Super Fighter and Thunderer just
might give the LC the strongest air force in the game

Thunderer
Cost: 1500 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 600
Armor: 25%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

It can only use up to a medium shield generator if that's something of a problem and this
never improves.  However the Thunderer is tough, moderately armored and can deliver
heavy firepower to suppress your foes

Thunderer m2
Cost: 1500 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 750
Armor: 50%
Speed: 25
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

The Thunderer m2 becomes tougher and better armored.  In either fighter/bomber or
heavy bomber role-the Thunderer is a powerful assault vehicle especially when given
a Super Fighter escort to punish enemy fighter craft.  In the bomber role, the Thunderer
is armed with the air sonic cannon which allows it to make sustained bombardment on
any ground target without endangering your own forces.

Phobos
Cost: 350 credits
Time needed: 10 seconds
HP: 30
Armor: 25%
Speed: 28
Hard Points: Special

While it is nice that the Phobos can fly and avoid most attacks that way, it doesn't
stop the fact that it is the most fragile vehicle in the game and in addition is the only
vehicle capable of mounting certain essential support equipment.  Could it have been
too much to ask for the LC to be able mount Phobos equipment on a Lunar or Moon?
In any case, the Phobos is very valuable and isn't especially cheap so make sure to
keep it well-protected

Unit Transporter
Cost: 1000 credits
Time needed: 1 minute
HP: 550
Armor: 50%
Speed: 36
Hard Points: Special

Extremely fast and well armored, the Unit Transporter can usually deliver ground units
safely or it can pick up stationary enemy units to drop to their deaths.

Mercury
Cost: 400 credits
Time needed: 15 seconds
HP: 900
Armor: 0
Speed: 32
Hard Points: 0

The supply ship of the LC, there's really nothing separating it from those of other
factions.  It's fast and very durable unfortunately it has no armor so anti-aircraft fire
will make short work of it.  Without an adequate number of Mercury and aerial supply
depots, you won't have enough ammo to sustain a long fight.



3.4	********LUNAR CORPORATION BUILDINGS********

Landing Zone
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 300
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

In the campaign this is one of the most important buildings in the game.  The landing
zone allows you to transfer money and resources from a mission site back to your
home base and vice versa.

Main Base
Size: 3x3
Resource Cost: 3000 credits
Energy Cost: 100 power
HP: 8000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 2 Heavy
	     2 Light

The Main Base gives the LC a production advantage in that it can build both
civilian and military vehicles instead of having separate facilities like the other
factions.

Not only that but with 8000 HP and 4 hard points, the Main Base can be one of
the most formidable defenses in the game-almost rivaling the UCS Fortress or LC
Guardian save for its lack of armor.  Note that the Heavy Hard Points in the Main Base
cannot mount Antimissiles except on the subweapon mounts of Heavy Electro-Cannons

Solar Power Plant
Size: 1x2
Resource Cost: 700 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The Solar Power Plant itself doesn't provide energy but it enables you to create
Solar Cells that do.  The Solar Power Plant can build up to 10 Solar Cells per Plant.

Solar Cell
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 100 credits
Energy Cost: produces 100 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Built by the Solar Power Plant, the Solar Cells must connect to each other or with
the Solar Power Plant.  The Cells provide plenty of power for relatively small space
and cost.

Unfortunately, the Solar Cells don't work under heavy cloud cover or night-time darkness.
Also Solar Cells have to be connected plus lack armor and toughness making them a prime
target for attack.

Solar Battery
Size: 1x2
Resource Cost: 700 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Solar Batteries absorb power from Solar Cells and Xyrex Power Plants, they then release
whatever charge they've stored when the Solar Cells are inactive.  The necessity for
Solar Batteries, even when Xyrex Power Plants are developed, is one of drawbacks of the LC.

Xyrex Power Plant
Size: 4x4
Resource Cost: 3000 credits
Energy Cost: produces 400 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The Xyrex Power Plant is resembles the regular power plants of the other factions.
It works regardless of the amount sunlight available and so it makes a nice fallback
for the LC.  Unfortunately it's very inefficient-it produces very little power for the
space it requires; in fact it's the largest building in the game.

Mine
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The LC Mine is unique in that it draws and processes resources directly therefore the
LC do not use Harvester units.  This can speed up the mining process and also renders
the LC less vulnerable to attacks aimed at denying resource flow

Aerial Supply Center
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Heavy

Once a Mercury has been assigned to an Aerial Supply Center, it will fly out and supply
units or buildings that are low on ammo.  Make sure to have an adequate supply of Supply
Centers and Mercury aircraft to avoid running out of ammo.

Headquarters
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3600
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 1 Light

The Headquarters can automate your base defense, the construction of units, upgrading of
building weapons and research paths.  It takes one Headquarters for each assignment.
The LC Headquarters is the toughest of the 3 factions

However I find only the automation of your base defense to be useful.  The computer is
notorious for making poor choices in other areas.  With base defense though, it'll open
fire at incoming foes from maximum range.

Research Center
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 2400
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Having 3 Research Centers will speed up research by 20%.  There's no further benefit to
building more than 3.  Research is a necessity in this game as players fight to win the
arms race.

Recycler
Size: 2x3
Resource Cost: 500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 3000
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The Recycler recycles units that have been sent there and returns half their original worth
In credits.  The Recycler is probably more useful to the LC than any other faction.  The LC
do not possess Repairer technology and so cannot upgrade their units in the field.

Tunnel Entrance
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 1000 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 1500
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

The Tunnel Entrance is the point of entry where units can go underground through a series of tunnels.

Laser Wall
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 100 credits
Energy Cost: 10 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Laser Walls can have a laser beam up to a 3 squares long between each projector.  Frankly
though I'm hesitant to use Laser Walls.  They're fragile by building standards
and typically all you need is to destroy one projector to open a large gap in the wall.
Finally while the energy cost per projector is low, the walls of other factions don't
use power at all

NEST
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 300 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 350
Armor: 50%
Hard Points: 1 Light

This is the earliest dedicated base defense a player can develop.  While the armor level
is good, the lack of firepower and toughness certainly isn't.  The advantages of using the
NEST includes small size lets it fit in spaces too small for other LC defense buildings,
it's short enough that weapon emplacements on taller buildings can fire over it safely, and
it uses no power.

Defender
Size: 1x2
Resource Cost: 400 credits
Energy Cost: 0
HP: 900
Armor: 50%
Hard Points: 2 Light

The Defender is basically a bigger and more powerful version of the NEST for only a little more
credits and space.  It retains the low height and no power consumption advantages of the NEST
but it has more than twice toughness as well as a pair of light hard points.

The Defender does suffer from somewhat low firepower due to its inability to mount Heavy weapons.
Overall though this is a good base defense until you develop the Guardian

Guardian
Size: 1x2
Resource Cost: 1300 credits
Energy Cost: 25 power
HP: 2500
Armor: 75%
Hard Points: 2 Heavy Type 2

At almost three times the toughness of the Defender, very heavy armor and the capacity to use
Heavy weapons for its hard points, this is THE DEFENSE for LC.  It is significantly more expensive
than the Defender but its sheer toughness, strong armor, heavy firepower and relatively low energy
cost makes this the most desirable of the LC base defenses.

Artillery
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 10000 credits
Energy Cost: 250 power
HP: 600
Armor: 0
Type: Projectile
Damage: 260
Ammo: 3
Range: 50
Hard Points: 0

This is the least damaging of all the various factions' artillery.  That said though, it is useful
in its ability to bombard targets from extremely long ranges-it's just not as potent as the other
base artillery pieces around.  Artillery makes an excellent base defense against ground units
especially if you place several in a line-make sure to set them to 'fire at will'.

When using artillery make sure to align them so that nothing tall is directly in front, otherwise
you'll blast yourself.  Also take into account the expense of Artillery and their high power
consumption.  Finally make sure to have some defensive structures nearby to help fend off units
that survived your artillery attacks

Weather Control Center
Size: 1x1
Resource Cost: 50 000 credits
Energy Cost: 400 power
HP: 1500
Armor: 0
Hard Points: 0

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, this is one causes the least damage(plus the
attack is pretty random in where it hits) but it does give the user a number of options
depending on the environment.  Another plus is that it's effect radius is the largest of
any weapon and the building needs little space.  Unfortunately the types of options available
to a Weather Control Center depend on the charge available plus the environment-desert conditions
are the worst as you can only make wind:

At 50% charge it can make rain (summer and spring), wind (all except moon) and
snow (winter)

At 100% charge it can make lightning storms (summer and spring) and meteor shower
(moon)

SDI Defense Center
Size: 2x2
Resource Cost: 1500 credits
Energy Cost: 50 power
HP: 1500
Armor: 0
Ammo: 1
Range: 15
Hard Points: 0

The SDI Defense Center fires a powerful laser to shoot down incoming nukes.  However
because it takes time to aim and has a slow rate of fire, it can only protect against
a small number of nukes.

4.0 WALKTHROUGH

Note that research cost and time is a lot more than in the skirmish or multiplayer games.
Offsetting this is how you're typically provided with some advanced units and a base of some sort
to start.  After the end of the mission, take everything that isn't nailed down and look for
opportunities to eek out some more cash and experience.  Also not every technology is available
for research and what technology is available costs more time and credits to research to offset
your ability to retain technology, money and units from level to level.  Finally you have a limit in
how many combat units you can produce (captured units also take up credits from this limit
however you can continue capturing enemy units even after using up all the credits in your
unit limit).

4.1			EURASIAN DYNASTY MISSIONS

	The Eurasian Dynasty missions are probably the second easiest of the three to do.
However they're probably the simplest faction to practice with and to get a feel of the game,
I'd recommend doing their missions first first.

	Before any missions actually begin, you're given a briefing by your commander telling
you a little about why you're here at this base and some heads up on being a member of the
Mobile Commandos.  He also mentions that you're going to be given some support but not to
count on it too heavily.

	Starting Base: Main Base
	 	          5 Power Plants
          		  2 Weapon Production Centers
          		  1 Vehicle Production Center

		*Upgraded Rockets have been totally researched for free

	Man, the General wasn't kidding when he said that the ED knows jack about
accounting.  If you look at the 3 base sites you'll see a lot of redundancy and poor
planning.  Since you don't start with any money, I'd recommend some of the buildings.
You can actually prune a lot from the main base but nothing can be sold from Base 1
and Base 2.    You might want do some selling in the beginning as you start with no
money whatsoever.  Another thing to keep in mind is that the profit from recycling for
the ED can vary wildly but it'll mention what percentage at the top of the screen, the most
I've seen is the high 70s so perhaps 80% is the most you can get back.  Money will be
tight initially but later on you can let rip with the spending sprees.

	Credits from your account on the mission site is automatically split up and sent
to your main base and research base when you end a mission.

*Technology not available for research include: Bomb Bay, Bomb, Ballistic Rocket Launcher,
Ballistic Rocket, Nuclear Silos, Irkutsk, Leviathan, and Kiev

			MISSION 1

TRUCKS or RESCUE

	Once you get the briefing from the General, a mission icon appears.  Pick it and
you are given 2 possible missions.  One is Trucks, where you must escort 6 convoy trucks
to another base and the other is Rescue, where you must find data from a discovered spy
hopefully rescuing him as well.  It really doesn't matter which mission you pick from other
than that each mission has its own research associated with it.  Let's talk about the Rescue
mission first

1) Rescue
Base Given: 4 Power Plants, 4 Heavy Towers, 1 Supply Depot, 1 Landing Zone,
       1 Vehicle Production Center, 1 Weapon Production Center
Units Given: Scanner A, Scanner B
Money Given: None
Payment: 15000 credits for research and 2 Promotion Points
Bonus: 	For finding the Spy alive, 3000 credits
For escorting Spy safely back, 3000 credits and 7 Promotion Points
For defeating all UCS units 1 Promotion Point
Research: Upg. Caspian, Upg. Helicopter Chaingun, Screamer

	Before going on this mission, load the Ukraine with the Groznys, Boyars and Taigas.
When you do all this and arrive at the mission site, the General will inform you that the UCS
have discovered one of your spies.  He barely escaped and is lost somewhere.  Your job
is to reach the data he's carrying and if possible rescue him as well.  You have 6 hours before
he freezes to death but to help you out, the ED has provided you with 2 special Scanner units.

	Scanner A and B
	HP: 900
	Armor: 25%
	Speed: About 25%
	Hard Points: 1 Light

	The Scanners are fast and durable, they come equip with a special tracker for locating
the spy and his vehicle.  So long as you don't hang around a danger spot, you should have no
problem surviving.  The way to locate them is this, you see some numbers indicating distance
at the top of the screen- the closer you are to the spy and vehicle, the smaller the number gets.

	The location of the spy is random and so you must use the two scanners.  Call in the
Ukraine but don't wait up for it as you'll just be wasting time.  Instead rush quickly to the general
location and look for a Caspian and the strange artifact beside it.  There'll be a Tiger II with Plasma
Cannons guarding it but it's easy to avoid.  Grab the item and you have retrieved the
data as well as the spy if he's not dead.  The General will give you your payment which he says
is 10000 credits for production and 10000 credits for research, if the spy is alive he'll give you
5000 credits if you bring him in safely.  Well, you actually get 15000 credits for research, 3000
for production and a bonus 3000 credits if you bring the spy back to the base alive (sometimes
the cheapskates don't give you the 3000 for finding him alive).  If you let the spy freeze to death,
the General is still pleased with your efforts and says he'll give you 20000 credits-which is
actually just 15000 credits for research.  Now you can end this mission as soon as you grab
the data but I'd suggest sticking around.

	If you want to earn some extra firepower for later use, research the ion cannon and
mount it on a Taiga or Siberia.  Located all around the map are isolated Tiger IIs with Plasma
Cannons and a trio of Tigers with 105mm Cannons.  Send your ion cannon unit with your
repair vehicles and go around capturing everything.  You can even capture the spy's Caspian
as well by taking it down with your ion cannon and sending a repair unit over (it's an advanced
model and even has some shields, only weak spot is that its chaingun is the lowest rank).
Heck if you really feel the ED is really ripping you off, you can ionize the base they gave you
and sell the buildings.  If you feel that capturing enemy units is a cheap tactic, you can easily
destroy the UCS units from the air as they have nothing that can attack aerial targets.

	Wonder why you want the Groznys?  Well 2 Dragons will attack your base with plasma
bombs and only the Groznys can safely defeat the Dragons unless you had researched AA guns
and have some AA guns around.  Otherwise the Dragons will wipe out your base.  Capture or
destroy all the UCS units and they'll give you an extra Promotion Point though there's no
congratulatory message this time

			MISSION 2

			TRUCKS OR RESCUE

2) Trucks

Base Given: 1 Power Plant, 1 Supply Depot, 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: 2 MI 27 Boyar, 6 Convoy Trucks
Money Given: None
Payment: 15000 credits for research, 3000 credits for production and 2 Promotion Points
Bonus: For escorting all 6 Convoy Trucks, 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
            For destroying LC base, 5 Promotion Points
Research: upg. Shield Projector 1000 PSU, upg. Laser Cannon, upg. Ion Cannon,
    upg. Rocket Launcher, upg. 20mm Bullets, upg. 105mm Bullets, upg. Grozny

*no matter which mission is picked 2nd, you can research: upg. 20mm Bullets, upg. 20mm
Bullets, upg. 105mm Bullets, upg. 105mm Bullets, upg. Laser Cannon

	You're told that there has been several attempts made to get to the other base.
All of them have been failures due to LC ambushes.  Now it's your turn to show your mettle.
The General gives you the pointer that a number of the LC units have no capacity to defend
themselves from air strikes.  He also mentions that there's an old Soviet base around that
should have some goodies kicking around.

	Convoy Truck
	HP: 750
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 0
	Speed: about 14
	Hard Points: 0

	[Okay the trucks you have been given have no capacity to defend themselves and
they have no armor or shields so it doesn't take much from the LC to destroy one.  However
the Convoy Truck will only move once an escort has explored a fair amount of area and so
it's generally not too difficult to get them through with no damage.  One last thing to keep
in mind is that the Convoy Trucks are not your property so you can't repair them.]

	The first thing to do for this mission is to load up all your Groznys (they'll do most
of the work), the both types of Pamirs, the Taigas and the Minelayers (their mines are useless
here, but their machine gun can provide some nice anti-air cover.  You won't need anything
else, so don't worry about construction or research.  There are some ammo and repair artifacts
near the landing zone of the mission site but it's far too early to get any use out of them.  The
Vehicle Production Centers at the site can't be used either

	Once you send them over to the mission site, unload them and have the Groznys and
Pamirs with rocket launchers fire at the ground. This'll free up some room in your magazines
to get a fresh supply of upgraded ammo to replace your crappy regular stuff.  Once they've been
re-supplied send the Groznys ahead of the road.  When you see a trio of Moon m3, the General will
cut in and deliver a message about how they should be close to their base (not really that close).
Now attack the Moons with your Groznys while bringing up your Pamirs, Minelayers and Taigas a safe
distance from the fight but ready to jump in when the Moons are weak.  The reason you don't want to
bring the ground units in, is that the Moons are armed with electro-cannons or sonic
cannons and can really hurt your ground  units.  However you want them close because the
Groznys have low ammo supply and may not be able to kill all the Moons without returning to the
base for a reload, but the Groznys will have gone far enough to get the Convoy moving forwards.
Once the Moons are destroyed, follow the winding road until you reach a row of debris that has
but one opening.  If you have a ion cannon then you might want to capture the Moons instead,
it shouldn't be too difficult as all the LC units at this stage have no shields.

	The convoy will stop here and wait for you to clear the area ahead.  Now beyond the
debris gate you'll see a straight road that will soon form a left turn.  Move your Pamirs and
Minelayers forward, with your Groznys slightly behind them.  You'll be attacked by a bunch of
Lunars using rockets.  While they can really hurt your Groznys with their rockets, they don't fare
very well against your ground force.  Repair anyone hurt and arrive at the bridge.  The bridge will
be guarded by Meteors using machine guns and Super Fighters with rocket launchers.  So bring
up your Pamirs with rocket launchers and your Minelayers as well, have them followed by the Groznys.
The Pamirs should take the brunt of the fire but their armor will take the worst of it,
while your other units finish them off.  Cross the bridge and you'll reach an area that's got plenty
of debris.  Move your Groznys forward or use your Ion Cannon unit because you'll once again
be facing a Moon with a sonic cannon and a second one with an electro-cannon .  Take them
out and follow the road where you'll see an artifact site with ammo and repair artifacts near a
network of bridges.  Send your Pamirs with rockets and the Minelayers onto the larger platform
located there while have the Groznys close by to support them.  They'll soon be attacked by more
Meteors and Super Fighters.  Destroy them and cross the next land mass.  When you reach land, send
your Groznys out first because there'll be a trio of Moons carrying sonic cannons and if lucky they
can make mincemeat out of your ground units, however keep some tanks handy because some Lunars
with rocket launchers come in to attack as well.  Alternately you can try to capture them as well

	Once the area is clear, the road leads to the ED base that the convoy is supposed to reach.
Lead the convoy past the upcoming artifact site and they'll go the rest of the way.
When all the surviving convoy trucks arrive, you'll get a message and receive your payment.
If you lost 1 or 2 trucks then the General will send you a message saying that he is glad to see
the convoy and will send you 10000 credits for production and 10000 for research.  Don't you believe
him, the ED accounting services will botch it and you actually get 15000 for research and 3000 for
production.  If you get all the trucks in safely then the General will say he's giving you a 5000
credit bonus which actually comes to an additional 3000 credits.  You can now leave the mission or
you can stick around for some more action.

	First check out the Soviet base, there's an artifact site if you need to use it.  There
are two special units that have joined you (make sure to notice them and click one them).

	Russilan AAR
	HP: 900
	Shield: 600
	Armor: 50%
	Speed: about 17
	Hard Points: Special
	Damage: 400
	Ammo: 50
	Range: 8

	[This is a really nice unit for dealing with pesky aircraft.  It comes with a powerful
anti-aircraft rocket launcher in addition to being very tough and well armored.  These are
especially useful if you decide to attack the LC base.  It even comes with some shields]

	Okay while you're still at the base, think about scoring some more cash.  Ionize
the building at the base and capture them to sell.  In addition, ionize the convoy trucks and
capture them for recycling later.  Finally the biggest profit to be had is this, check out those
units lying all around the base.

	Heavy Tank with 105mm Cannon
	HP: 900
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 50%
	Speed: about 14
	Hard Points: Special
	Ammo: 90
	Range: 8

	[These heavy tanks are weak by heavy tank standards but will still prove very
useful.  The description says they're armed with 105mm cannons but that's not true.
What they are carrying is a variant heavy rocket launcher upg.2.  So they're quite
effective against air and ground targets-the drawback is they fire double rockets which
burns through ammo at a quick rate.]

	The heavy tanks are currently inactive and many of them are in bad shape.
However a quick jolt with the ion cannon and send over a repair unit to bring it under
your control.  Get the tanks patched up and you'll be grateful you got them because it'll
be a while before you get to research a heavy tank of any sort.  Since their rockets can
hit aerial targets, they'll be very useful against the LC base.

	Once that's all sorted out and you strip-mined the base for what it's worth, you
might want to check out the southeast corner of the map if you haven't been there before.
There are 4 Moon m3 with electro-cannons and while you can easily dispatch them with your
Groznys it'd be much more profitable to sneak up on them and capture them.  It's a bit tricky
but you could do it with only one ion cannon and your repair units.  Now it's time to deal with
the LC base.

	Over to the northwest corner of the map is a mountain and that is where the LC base
is located.  The mountain can be crossed by a narrow, winding road but the road is guarded
by 4 Small Towers with rocket launchers.  Furthermore there is a large contingent of Meteors
and Super Fighters to contend with as well.  So park your units that can hit aerial targets
at the base of the mountain, and have your Groznys hold position there as well.  Select one
Grozny to go close to the base and draw out the enemy air force.  Rush the Grozny back to
position and you'll soon wipe them out, save for a few that hung back.  Next send the Pamirs
with 105mm cannons and other heavy hitters to attack the small towers but have your other
units guard them.  The remaining enemy aircraft will come to attack but they'll be quickly
destroyed.  And the Small Towers shouldn't last too long against your cannon, rocket fire
and energy weapons.  When they're gone the LC base is totally defenceless.  Destroying the
base will got you a positive report from the General plus some promotion points.  Before
ending the mission, you can take over and sell the base provided for you to pocket
the money.

			MISSION 3

			MONGOLIA OR IZBEKISTAN

	Now we get to the more difficult missions, hopefully you'll have picked up a lot of
credits and interesting units in your journey to help make things easier.  We'll assume that
the next mission taken is Mongolia

3) Mongolia

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: None
Money Given: 5000 credits for activating the Gruz, 25000 credits for locating a site
	          for artillery
Payment: 10000 credits for production, 15000 credits for research and 8 Promtion Points
Bonus: For destroying all LC units 3000 credits and 3 Promotion Points
Research: upg. Screamer, upg. Building Grabber, upg. Rocket Launcher II,
    Helicopter Rocket Launcher, Medium Defense Building, upg. Caspian,
    Unit Transporter

*Artillery is researched for free once a certain task is completed

	This mission isn't so much difficult as it is tedious.  If you have a surplus of cash
you might want to research the Unit Transporter as it can help speed this mission up some.

	To begin with the General tells you that there are 3 LC bases in the area that must
be destroyed.  The first base is not to far away and he'll send bombers once you discover
it, after that you're on your own.  First load up units on Ukraine but keep in mind that the
LC have lots of buildings and units equipped with rocket launchers so your Groznys aren't
going to be nearly as useful as before.  Once set, you should take the winding road north
of the supply depot (you can't use it as its strictly for the bombers).  As you go a solitary
Moon m3 with electro-cannon will attack you.  After you deal with this threat you continue
through the road until you see 2 Defenders.  The Defenders are placed to dissuade anyone
from attacking the base.  While you can destroy them, its probably easier just to capture
them.  In any case when you move past the Defenders, a gang of Moons and Lunars
come attacking you with rockets.  When you defeat them, move closer to the base and
eventually the General will inform you of the airstrike.  An armada of Han will fly and
attack with rockets and bombs.  However, the base has quite a lot of defense firing
rockets at them and so it'll take a while.  To speed things up, get your army to destroy
the Guardian, the Headquarters and the Aerial Supply Depot.  The Han will then come
and annihilate the base, afterwards becoming inactive.  Now you get information about
dealing with the other bases-the 2nd base has a line of powerful defenses but spies had
planted bombs at the power plants and the detonator is in the tunnels, the 3rd base
requires you to place artillery

	Go forward and you'll see a tunnel entrance plus an artifact site loaded with
ammo, you're probably spent on ammo so load up to your heart's content.  Afterwards,
go down to the tunnels.  In the tunnels are a pair of Gruz but they're not operational,
you must find an artifact to activate them.  Besides that, there's some other nice stuff
here.  In the webwork of narrow tunnels to the south is an artifact that gives you a
whopping 10000 credits.  Go into the larger tunnels and you'll find a room full of
repairs and in a nearby room is the artifact you're looking for.  Once you get the
Gruzes working, the General will congratulate you and give you 5000 credits to work
with.  He wants you to go look for a secondary network of tunnels.

	You can't reach those from your current location, so send your Gruzes to
the surface and go to the area that is west of the tunnels where you found the Gruzes.
Once there build a tunnel entrance and start making big tunnels leading south.  Eventually
you'll be stopped by solid rock, now bring your army to where your Gruzes are and have
the Gruzes look for a location to build another tunnel entrance which will lead to the surface.
Once you do so, go up and you'll see another tunnel entrance plus a bridge to your west.
Send your troops down those tunnels as they lead to some nice items.  Explore out the
tunnels and you'll see that to the east are 3 rooms that have been sealed off.  Use a
Gruz to tunnel the sealing and you find the 1st room has 10000 credits, the second room
has six shield projectors and a lot of repairs, and the third room has lots of ammo.  As for
who should get the shields, you'll probably want to save these for captured LC or UCS units
that have the most advanced chassis and weaponry but no shields (for example the Moon m3
with electro-cannon upg.1 is typically carrying the best chassis of its kind and the weapon
it carries is as good as it gets.).  If you manage to capture the Moon m3 with the electro-cannon
in the beginning or have others brought over from previous missions then have one pick up
a shield, we'll save the rest for some later potential prizes.

	Now bring your troops to the surface and with the Moon m3 that is shielded, go south
to the broken bridge.  You'll see a line of Guardians and they have electro-cannons and rocket
launchers, send your Moon m3 to quickly harass them a little.  Eventually they'll send some
Lunars and Moons over to attack you, as well as hopefully a Crater with Heavy Rocket Launcher.
Bait the enemy unit to follow you as you guide your Moon back to the rest of the army.  Have
them destroy the Moons and Lunars while you capture the Crater.  The Crater has a fully
upgraded chassis and weapon so get it to pick up a shield generator from that tunnel room.
Now with repair your Moon and send it back out again to the south.  Repeat the same trick
and another batch of enemy units come along with the same type of Crater.  Repeat and you
have another Crater in your possession.  Give it a shield and you'll have some fairly significant
firepower in your hands.

	Okay now that you're army is well stocked and hopefully larger by 2 Craters, go back
to the tunnel entrance with the 3 bonus rooms.  Now go straight south with your Gruzes and
eventually you'll hit a dead end.  The wall can be dug out though and will lead you into a new
set of tunnels.  Explore out the tunnels and you'll find an artifact.  Grab it and it'll detonate
rendering the line of Guardians useless.  Now go and repair the bridge, then send your troops
over (especially your ion cannon unit) and destroy the Guardians.  The 2nd base isn't totally
helpless, they have a few Small Towers and they'll send the rest of their troops over including
a Crater carrying a Heavy Electro-Cannon with Rocket Launcher submount.  Capture that and
wipe out the rest.  Now as your busily destroying the 2nd base you'll want to check on your
main base.  Hopefully you left the Groznys at home as well as the Pamirs with rockets.
Move them over to guard the landing zone, this will be important very soon.  Once you destroy
the 2nd base, look for a plateau on the mountain that is surrounded by fencing.  When you find
it the General congratulates you and says you found the perfect place for artillery placement.
He mentions that you need to support the artillery with power plant and supply depot.  He'll
give you something like 25000 credits and the technology to make artillery!  Now move your
army back to guard the tunnel entrances and move the Gruz to the plateau.  If the sky is clear
then begin production but if there is a heavy thunderstorm then move far away from the mountains
and wait it out-the lightning bolts will make short work of any unit caught in its path.
Chances are you'll soon be interrupted by an urgent message saying your main base is under
enemy attack!

	A small group of Gargoyles armed with plasma cannons are flying in to destroy
your base starting with your landing zone.  Well if you placed the Groznys and Pamirs like
I mentioned then they'll wipe out the Gargoyles with ease.

	Load up your Boyars and ship them to the mission site.  Return to the mission
site and check out what the Gruz is doing.  You only need one supply depot, one power plant
and one artillery.  Before you get the artillery firing at anything, assign the Boyars to the
supply depot and they'll give your troops some much needed supplies.  When they're done,
send a Unit Transporter if you have one to the tunnel entrance where the rest of your troops
are.  Now fly to the west along that bridge until you spot a group of Moons. Get your artillery
to paste them.  Fly along the bridge and you'll the Moons were guarding an artifact site but
ignore that for now.  Send your Unit Transporter to scout the area just to the west of your
artillery.  There's the base and it's ripe for bombardment.  As soon as you start to blasting
them to shreds, the LC will retaliate by sending an army to deal with your tunnel entrances.
There's nothing especially powerful in that army so your forces will easily wipe them out.
Continue to bombard the base until it's destroyed.  Victory is yours and the General says
he'll pay you 30000 credits (hey this time he's get it fairly close, hopefully this will be a
continuing trend) and you'll get a medal.  Now to get the bonus, go to the artifact site I
just mentioned it'll be guarded by Moons with sonic cannons and a Crater with
heavy electro-cannon and a banner as submount.  Capture the Crater and deal with
the rest as you see fit.  Next look around for any Mercuries that are still alive and destroy
them too.  End of story

		MISSION 4

		MONGOLIA OR IZBEKISTAN

4) Izbekistan

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: 1 Convoy Truck
Money Given: None
Payment: 3000 credits for production, 15000 credits for research and 2 Promotion Points
Bonus: For destroying the power plants, 3000 credits and 10 Promotion Points
            For destroying all the UCS units, 3000 credits and 3 Promotion Points
Research: Thor, upg. Thor

* note that whichever mission you do you now get to research Stealth Unit and
upg. Screamer

	Izbekistan is the beginning of a multi-part rescue mission.   The General has told you
that you must retrieve the Cargo Salamander from an island to your west and that the base
defenses are powered by a series of power plants.  I suggest going after the power plants
first to significantly weaken your foes.  Oh yeah, a little note-don't bother producing any
Thors this mission, as you have no research on anything to equip them with.

	First load up a team including the Groznys and 2 or more Unit Transporters.  The thing
to keep in mind in this mission is that you cannot construct anything.  So don't bring a Gruz.
Fly the Groznys far to the south and then go west to the land mass.  When you see a forest,
go there and stop.  Now fly in your army to the same location.  I suggest you have an ion
cannon handy as this mission can really increase your power and since ammo can be hard
to get you might want to get some energy weapons too.  Once your troops have arrived
it's time to go further to the west.  As for the Convoy Truck you began with, just leave it
alone for the being.

	The power plants aren't easily accessible as they're high on a mountain top and well
guarded.  Now the UCS have Spiders with rocket launchers and Tigers with 105mm cannons,
which should be a pushover especially if you Moons with energy weapons, Craters and
Heavy Tanks-if that was all the UCS had this would be a cakewalk.  Unfortunately (or fortunately
depending on how you look at it) they have 5 Grizzlies-the toughest units in the game

	Grizzly III
	HP: 3600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 19
	Hard Point: 1 Heavy

	[The Grizzly is easily one of the best units in the game.  Not only is it phenomenally tough
but it is heavily armored and fast.  It's firepower is actually somewhat less than that of a fully
optimized Jaguar but you can't always expect the Jaguar to mount the light weapon, heavy
weapon and weapon submount combo.  Once you see the Grizzly in action, don't be surprised
if you single-handedly win entire missions with a couple of them, it's that powerful!!!]

	Well if the power plants are that well guarded how about trying another target.  At the
base of the mountain where the power plants are, there is a the UCS base for producing new
units and keeping them supplied.  There's also an artifact site with lots of ammo which you'll
need pretty soon.  Have your Groznys attack the Tigers guarding the artifact site.  Next have
your ground units destroy or capture the buildings.  Keep your ion cannon unit as you'll eventually
attract attention from the enemy.  They'll start by sending a couple of Spiders which you can
easily destroy but following close is a mighty Grizzly carrying a heavy rocket launcher and rocket
launcher tandem.  Capture the Grizzly and take out the Spiders.  Now eventually another wave
comes this time its some Tigers and a Grizzly with heavy plasma cannons and plasma cannons
tandem.  Destroy the Tigers and capture the Grizzly.  Now this particular Grizzly gives a heavy
advantage, the UCS aren't making much use of energy weapons or shields so take advantage
of that.  Take the Grizzly and attack the power plants a bit.  Eventually another Grizzly comes,
armed with the same rocket tandem that the first Grizzly had.  Capture that and deal with
the Spiders that are in the way.  Eventually another Grizzly with rockets comes along to
investigate and capture him to.  With 4 Grizzlies, go and attack the power plants.  Eventually
the fifth and last Grizzly comes to the rescue, but just give him a jolt and you'll have 5 Grizzlies
in your possession.  Once you wipe out the base and the units there, you'll probably have enough
points to go up a rank.  Now it's time to capture the Cargo Salamander.

	First bring everyone back to your original location, advance to the west.  The outpost
here will be easy to dismantle with the power all gone.  There's an artifact site at this outpost
to provide you with much needed ammo.  Now follow the road to the west but keep an eye
out for land mines.  The mines left here can only be destroyed by running into it.  So take your
Unit Transporters to lift your forces just past the minefield.  Once there you'll see an artifact site
to the north, it's especially well stocked with ammo and repairs plus 30000 credits.  Grab these
and continue where you'll see another group of mines on the road leading to the Cargo
Salamander.  Now use the Unit Transporters to fly in the toughest units you have.  Let them
destroy the Small Towers guarding the Cargo Salamander.  Next fly in convoy truck and place
it directly on top of the Salamander.  You'll get a message saying that the Salamander has been
successfully captured.  Now you can fly the Salamander back home and end this mission

			MISSION 5

			ABER OR EUROPE

	Okay the ABER is the followup mission for Izbekistan, you'll have to send your Cargo
Salamander to rescue the soldiers from UCS headquarters.  Europe has you looking for your
nuclear missiles.  I'd recommend doing the ABER first as it can provide you with some heavy
firepower for the Europe mission.

5) ABER

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: None
Money Given: None
Payment: 15000 credits for research, 3000 credits for production and 2 Promotion Points
Bonus: For destroying all the UCS buildings 3000 credits and 10 Promotion Points
For destroying all the UCS units 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
Research: Heavy Ion Cannon, Heavy Laser Cannon, Heavy Cannon, Heavy Rocket Launcher,
	    Helicopter Heavy Rocket Launcher, upg. Helicopter Heavy Rocket Launcher,
    upg. Heavy Rocket (guided 25%), upg. Heavy Rocket (guided 50%),
    upg. Heavy Rocket (guided 100%), Han, upg. Han, Volga, upg. Volga

	You are given a complete map of the surface,  now look at the northwest corner.
High on the mountain top is the headquarters which is well protected with mines, towers
and Jaguar with lots of plasma cannons.  Next take a look at the southwest plus southeast
corner of the map, there are plasma conrol centers and they're biggest reason why nothing
 should be built here.  Throughout this map are a number of teleporters and tunnel entrances
that you'll have to use to rescue the prisoners.

	First fly in your Cargo Salamander (make sure it is holding fire) and have it go as
far south as it can.  Eventually it'll reach a teleporter, so that take that and it'll teleport you in
front of another teleporter.  Take that teleporter as well and you'll be taken to a shoreline
where a Hydra is waiting for you (There are 2 Hydras, about the only place in the game you'll ships
of any kind at all for that matter).  Escape the Hydra by going to the nearby tunnel entrance.
Down the tunnels you'll want to go north and take the tunnel entrance there but first explore
the tunnels as they have some artifact sites kicking around.  Once you get repairs, go up the
tunnel entrance and on your map look for a place with lots of tanks.  There's a teleporter there
that'll transport you near the headquarters, bypassing this stage's only Jaguar (it'll make an
excellent addition to your forces if you capture it).  So make a quick run for that teleporter.
When you make it just avoid the mines and go to the headquarters.

	The General will congratulate you and tell you that the men want action, take them
to the tanks and wreak havoc.  So teleport back to the area with the tanks and reach them.
You'll take control of the tanks and I suggest having them hold position to take stock of your situation.
First off you get 6 Heavy Tanks with 105mm Cannons and 10 Tanks C 105mm, you might have
already had some experience with the Heavy Tanks but here's the specs on you other find.

	Tank C 105mm
	HP: 900
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 50%
	Speed: about 17
	Hard Points: Special
	Ammo: 160
	Range: 8

	[Ignore what the name says, this is essentially a Russilan with a variant 120mm
double cannon. While you can get a lot of mileage out of this tank, the 120mm double cannon
on it is almost exactly the same as the single barreled version-the only difference is the higher
ammo count and using two shells at a time rather than one.  Even the improvements from
using upgraded bullets are the same.  Outside of its sleek looks, there's no reason to keep
this once you develop the Kruschev or Ural and the regular 120mm double cannon]

	A Panther, a Spider and a Tiger are attacking you so blast them to bits.  There's some repair
and a huge load of shield projectors lying around.  Don't have your tanks grab the shield projectors
as they can easily just be upgraded.  Instead fly in your mighty non-ED units like the Grizzlies
and the Jaguar on this stage that could make better use of the shields.  Now use your Ukraine to
fly in your most preferred troops who could use shielding as well as the repair units to upgrade
the tanks you just found.  Now go around blasting everything to kingdom come.  Nothing should
give you any difficulty.

			MISSION 6

			ABER OR EUROPE

6) Europe

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone, 8 Small Towers
Units Given: 1 MI 27 Boyar, 3 T 120 Pamirs with 105mm Double Cannon, and
       2 TK Taigia 2 with Repairer upg.1
Money Given: 30000 credits
Payment: 15000 credits for research, 3000 credits for production and 8 Promotion Points
Bonus: For destroying the UCS base 3000 credits and 3 Promotion Points
For destroying all the UCS units 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
Research: Earthquake Generator, upg. Earthquake Generator, Heavy Tower, Kruschev

*regardless of which mission is chosen, you can research: upg. Heavy Cannon,
upg. 120mm Bullets, upg. Heavy Rocket Launcher, upg. Heavy Rocket Launcher II,
upg. Heavy Laser Cannon, Upg. Heavy Ion Cannon

	You are alerted that the LC have captured your nuclear silos.  You must get
them back so get cracking!

	This is probably the first mission where you can really mine a lot of money so bring
a Gruz or two.  Assemble a strong force with your Gruzes and load them on the Ukraine.
When you start your mission, you'll find that they gave you a base of sorts located inside
a hollowed-out rock formation.  Have the repair units they gave you, upgrade themselves and
call the Ukraine.  Now a powerful thunderstorm has hit just a little in front of your base so
don't venture out until you organize your troops a little.  Send the Pamirs to the recycler
as they're just going to get in your way.  The attack force along with the Gruzes should
be taken directly west of your base.   You'll find a bridge to cross and once you do so,
you'll be on a landmass with a river directly in front of you.  If you have powerful amphibious
or hover units like the Volga or Crater, just click on the land to the other side of the river.
Your other units will have to take the long route around.  Across the river is a LC mining
operation that is protected by nothing more than some Moons and NESTs.  Destroy everything
here and set up your own mining operation, 2 mines and 2 refineries will totally cover
everything.

	Now your research base will eventually be attacked by a trio of Gargoyles with plasma
cannons, so transport your Groznys and Russilan AARs there.  Have the Russilans placed
on the cliff behind the research centers where a small tower is because that's near where the
Gargoyles appear.  The Groznys should be close by in case the Gargoyles evade the Russilans.
WIth everything secure, send your Ukraine to fetch another powerful force plus 2 to the mission site.
The weaker of the forces should take over guard duties of the mining operation while the
stronger will be used for a full frontal assault to recapture your silos.  Since you captured the
mining operations, the LC will have to split their forces and will be low on credits for production.
So your assault team will only face a couple of Moons and Lunars, take them down and you'll
face two rows of Guardians that have some backup from NESTs.  Since they're only equipped
with rocket launchers, your attack force will barely be injured as you wipe them out.

	When the LC defense is shattered you'll find your silos and other buildings have been
disabled.  Before you fix them, look for a tunnel entrance.  When you find it, send 4 fast units
down there and have one placed past each of the tunnels in the four directions.  Now restoring
those buildings but as soon as you restore a missile control center, the General alerts you that
the LC have activated the self-destruct, however the 4 switches controlling it are in the tunnels.
Well you're given plenty of time and since you already have units down there it'll only take a few
seconds to this.  When you complete the task, the General sends his compliments and the
mission can be ended.  You can stick around though and mop up the rest of the LC.

	Their main base is in the southwest corner of the map and is a tall rock formation surrounded
by water, so it can only be accessed by flight, hovering or amphibious capability.
Now you can run in and go for a firefight which is risky as there's not only Guardians but the
Main Bases are well-armed too, but it's still easy to do.  The other option is build artillery and
shell them to oblivion.  The final method is to simply launch the nukes at them.  Now mine out
all the resources and sell everything off including the silo base you recaptured.

			MISSION 7

			WESTERN EUROPE

	There's no other mission branch, so get ready to fight in Western Europe.

7) Western Europe

6) Europe

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: 1 MI 106 Cossack with Helicopter Double Chaingun. 3 ZT 101 Siberia with Laser
	        Cannon
Money Given: 30000 credits
Payment: 15000 credits for research, 3000 credits for production and 8 Promotion Points
Bonus: For destroying the northern UCS base 15000 credits and 3 Promotion Points or
for destroying all the UCS units 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
Research: upg. 120mm Bullets, upg. 120mm Bullets, Heavy Defense Building, upg. Kruschev,
    upg.Kruschev, Ural, upg. Ural

	First load up your Ukraine, since the UCS has some very powerful Jaguars I'd also
recommend some ion cannons to capture them.  It's important to load a Gruz as well since
this mission can see you mining a lot of credits.  Once you have a powerful party loaded,
activate this mission.

	The General will inform you that the UCS have captured 3 nuclear missile launchers
and are trying to work out the passwords to control them.  They'll succeed in 3 days time so
you must stop them before then, the control mechanism for the nukes are somewhere in the
tunnels below the nukes.  When you grab it'll put the nukes under your control.  Well with
that all said, the units the General so kindly provided you with are not even close to being
a match for what the UCS is using.  So call up the Ukraine and unload your troops.

	There are two paths from where you start, one to the south and the other to the east.
While the nukes are located to the east, I'd recommend going south first.  The path leading
east has some UCS artillery placed on the mountain tops, they'll blast any ground troops
heading east not to mention there's some Cargo Salamanders with plasma cannons to help
work your forces over as well.  Of course you can simply send some helicopters to blow them
up and do the shortcut to the nukes.  This shortcut has you first destroying the artillery, then
transport a Gruz to the area with all the power plants to make a tunnel entrance.  Then just
tunnel east and you'll reach the tunnel system where the control mechanism is.

	Still I'd go for the south first as it'll eventually take you to the UCS mining and production
site.  If you go south you'll eventually come across a trio of Tigers with plasma cannons guarding
a long stretch of railroad tracks.  There's also 10000 credits located amongst the tracks roughly
in this vicinity.  You can grab that later, you might as well take down the UCS mining operation
before they extract too much.

	Now once you're past the tracks and in the southern region of the map, you will be
attacked by Dragons, once you've beaten them take your forces east.  You'll come across stiff
UCS resistance-the minor stuff being some Spiders and Tigers, more worrisome are the
Panthers and the fiercest threat comes from the Jaguars.  However you're ace in the hole is
that these units have no shields, so slaughter them with energy weapons and try to capture
the Jaguars (there's 5 carrying heavy plasma cannons and 3 with rocket launchers).  Eventually
a pair of shielded Panthers carrying heavy rocket launchers come after you.  Wipe them out
and start working over the base.  Blow up the base defenses and take out the refineries plus
Harvesters.  But leave their Mammoths alone (if you have Unit Transporters, just use those to grab
them and place them in an isolated area with no building space) because if you destroy or capture
all the UCS units you get the lesser bonus.  Anyway once you've secured the area, build a mine and
refinery to start the cash flow running.  After all this is done, push north and go for
the nukes.

	First remember to take out the artillery, but once you do so the northern base is a cinch.
They have a lot of towers and a pair of fortresses but none of them are using anything other
than chainguns.  So your forces can easily mop them up, now send someone down the tunnels.

	Before you grab the control mechanism, you should place ready some units at your
main base for another round with the Gargoyles.  They'll attack soon after you grab the control
mechanism.

	The control mechanism is located in a large room with lots of pillars and is near a number of
artifact sites.  There's the regular ammo and repair but there's one particular site that has 40000
credits and 4 shield projectors.  Send some unshielded units that you really like to pick them up
(such as your choice amongst the 8 Jaguars you might have captured).  When you grab the
control mechanism, the nukes are yours (they're Volgas with ballistic rocket launchers).  One
thing to keep in mind is that once you use a nuke, you will not be supplied with more ammo so
use it wisely.  If you do use a nuke, you should sell the Volga afterwards as it just occupies
a large chunk of your population limit.

	Mine everything out, recycle obsolete units, research what you want and start producing
some heavy hitters because we're down to the final missions now.  Also you'll want to have some
anti-aircraft units in the vicinity of the landing zone at the main base for the next mission.

			MISSION 8

	The following missions are part of Operation Umbrella which is designed to stop the
LC's Project Sunlight.  There's no avoiding them and also you've reached the apex of technology
so there's no new research available.

			AFRICA

8) Africa

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone, 1 Vehicle Production Center, 1 Weapon Production Center,
       6 Small Towers, 1 Research Center, 1 Supply Depot. 4 Power Plants
Units Given: 2 MI 106 Cossacks with Helicopter Double Chaingun. 3 T 120 Pamir with
	       Double 105 Cannon, 2 M 140 Grozny with Helicopter Rocket Launcher upg.2
Money Given: 30000 credits
Payment: 15000 credits for research, 3000 credits for production and 8 Promotion Points
Bonus: For destroying LC base 15000 credits and 3 Promotion Points
            For destroying all the UCS units 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
Research:  None

	The General informs you that Operation Umbrella is underway to stop the LC.  The first
step is to destroy the UCS mining operation and control the resources here so you can eventually
establish a large army for Operation Umbrella.

	Okay hopefully you have a powerful force already loaded up in the Ukraine, because as
soon as the General finishes briefing you, you'll be under attack.  The base was poorly planned
in layout so some buildings aren't close enough to a power plant and have no power.  The defensive
buildings are also fairly weak and are too far spread to concentrate fire effectively.
Luckily the initial attack is by the LC using a mostly Lunar attack force, so it should be easy to
fight off.  Hopefully the Ukraine will arrive soon to take the heat off your base and allow you to
tailor the base more to your liking.

	Soon enough there's an attack on your main base and this time it's with Bats armed with
heavy rocket launchers.   They may be tougher than the Gargoyles but they're still easy to take
down.  Once you've taken care of them, you should set up a mining operation of your own.
If you're going to use aircraft, then bring them over immediately especially if you want to use
more Boyars, a heavy wind will soon take place and last for a few days which prevents aircraft
from taking off the ground-this can end up blocking factories or the landing zone

	Now start moving your forces south, you'll constantly be attacked by LC Super FIghters,
Meteors, Lunars and Moons,  meanwhile the UCS will take you on with Gargoyles, Cargo Salamanders
and Panthers.  Annihilate them and go further south until you reach the middle of the map.  Now
the LC base is in the south while the UCS are in the east.  Both bases are well defended and are
heavily armed with artillery.  If you still have the nukes from the previous mission, it wouldn't be
a bad idea to use them to soften up a base.  Considering that is one of the last fights, you can
splurge on building artillery and use a spotter to pinpoint enemy positions for some heavy
bombardment.  Otherwise send your most heavily armored units to attack the enemies'  defenses
and endure any artillery fire until you have to retreat.  You'll eventually wear them down and
probably not take any casualties.

	The UCS base is laden with small towers, heavy towers and some fortresses.  As well
many of their buildings are equipped with plasma cannons.  So shields are very important here.
Try to pick off their artillery with quick air strike and you should be able to destroy the rest of the
base.  You'll have to contend with some Panthers, Salamanders and a pair of Jaguars carrying
heavy plasma cannons but without their artillery they should be easy to destroy.  There's also
a series of tunnels in the area, about 3 in total.  Each one can get you 30000 credits each but
one set of tunnels (the type with the high tech-looking walls) has a pair of Jaguars with plasma
cannons waiting to ambush you.

	When you destroy the UCS base then victory is yours, but you can also go after the LC
base.  Now the LC aren't that dangerous though one spot on their base has a very tight formation
of artillery, just watch out for them or make some artillery to wipe them out.  Use some quick strikes
from the air to scout them out and pinpoint the enemy defenses for your artillery (mind you
the LC base has a severe lack of firepower compared to the UCS one, you can simply run in
and blow everything up with your troops if they are well shielded).  Once you wipe out the first
line of buildings, you can push further south.  You'll find a pair of Crushers m3 armed with heavy
sonic cannons and four special units.

	PROTOTYPE
	HP: 600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 28
	Hard Points: Special
	Ammo: 20
	Range: 7

	[The PROTOTYPE is a very powerful unit.  It's the alien craft that the LC's New Hope
and Fang are based on, though it's far more powerful than the New Hope.  It's tough, extremely fast,
hovers, and is heavily armored but its regeneration ability isn't as good as that of the New
Hope-it recovers 3 HP per second.  Its plasma beam does 125 points of damage and can really
rip up an unshielded unit.  Too bad the LC didn't have these guys equipped with shields but they
are still a welcome addition to your group if you capture them.]

	Moving further on and you'll eventually meet some Craters with heavy electro-cannons,
Fat Girls c4 with rocket launchers, a Moon and most dangerous of all-a Crion.  Try to capture
the Crion and if you succeed in doing so, the LC base is toast unless you left their artillery alone.
Anyways you're done clearing out the LC and UCS forces here, just work over any stragglers and
mine the resources (there's an immense amount of resources on this scenario, you'll probably be
rich enough to max out for your unit limit and finish researching every technology available).

		MISSION 9

		FLORIDA

	This is your last mission where you get to use your army and other resources, so throw
everything at them.  You've got nothing to lose in doing so

9) Florida

Base Given: 1 Landing Zone
Units Given: None
Money Given: 30000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: For destroying UCS base 15000 credits and 3 Promotion Points
            For destroying all the enemy units 3000 credits and 2 Promotion Points
Research:  None

	Okay the General informs you that the UCS have space port in Florida, your job is to
take it over and send a launch to the moon.  However the space port is heavily guarded so expect
a big fight.

	Load up your Ukraine but make sure there's a Gruz amongst them.  When you do so,
send them to the mission.  You'll quickly be attacked by ground units from one side (typically
Panthers and Cargo Salamanders, occasionally Jaguars and even Grizzlies) and the other side
will under constant attack from Gargoyles.  Establish strong base defenses and a lot of supply
depots.  There's a number of resource fields to the north of you, though you should be able to
truck over large sums of credits.

	Now the UCS base is east of the middle of the screen, it's guarded by a lot of towers
and fortresses plus a couple of Grizzlies and Jaguars.  However your forces should easily
outnumber them and will overwhelm them with no effort.  If you're not confident, just put up
some artillery in the area, the UCS base doesn't have any so it can't fight back during an artillery
match.  Wipe out the base and proceed north near the space port.

	The space port is isolated by a large chasm, not only that but there's plenty of artillery
and other defensive structures surrounding the space port.  Set up your own artillery and using
a helicopter as spotter, blow up all the UCS artillery and as many fortresses and towers as you
can.  There'll still be some guards-Grizzlies who have been cloaked by Spiders carrying
shadow generators, so send someone with a noise generator or else put your Gruz over to
construct a radar.  There are four tunnel entrances surrounding the space port-each one
must be entered to get the individual control mechanisms.  If you accidentally blow them up,
just build a new tunnel entrance over the destroyed one.  Finish the mission and you'll be blasting
off into outer space.

			MISSION 10

			MOON

10) Moon

Base Given: None
Units Given: 7 Escorts, General Fiodorow
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  None

	This is the big finale, you must escort General Fiodorow to the tunnels below Project
Sunlight where he can activate the codes to blow it up.  You have no army, no credits-nothing
to back you up save the escorts but it should be more than enough.

	Escort
	HP: 600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 28
	Hard Points: Special
	Ammo: 10
	Range: 6

	[The Escort is very powerful ground unit that looks like a flying saucer.  It uses LC
technology so it can float and also regenerate in addition to being toughness and heavily
armored.  The Escort carries an energy weapon that fires bolts of energy which inflicts heavy
damage on any ground target, however don't you believe it when it says it does 800 damage.
I've had to hit unshielded Moons with multiple shots to destroy one.  Still it's probably one of
the best units in the game]

	General Fiodorow is riding a Russilan AAR with a power shield generator 600 PSU.
There aren't any flyers in this stage, so the General is going to be little more than cannon fodder
here.

	First off there should be an artifact site in your vicinity, it contains the usual stuff but
also has energy recharges, 3 shield generators and a map.  Grab them as nearby are some
Moons.  Destroy them and withdraw if necessary.  Now go southeast to the centre of the screen
but watch out for land mines!

There's a path that will take you near Project Sunlight, even though you can't reach
Project Sunlight directly from here you still need to go.  It's the only path to the tunnel entrance
you must take and as well it has an artifact site with 2 more shields.  Go for the site and pick
up the shields.  You'll face a horde of Craters armed with heavy electro-cannons, you should
try to destroy one or two and withdraw.  Keep doing that to thin them out and eventually stop
them for good.  Now travel north along the path which leads to what appears to be 3 rings
on your map.  There's an artifact site here as well as the LC base.  The artifact site has nothing
extraordinary, so use it only for healing.  The LC base is guarded by New Hopes, Craters and
a few Crushers for good measure.  To top it off there's a lot of Guardians and even a pair of
artillery that can easily wipe out your troops.  Unfortunately everything is too closely clustered
to just sneak past them so you have to fight it out.   I'd recommend sending one of your guys
to draw out the artillery fire.  Once the artillery runs out of ammo, quickly rush in and destroy
them.  You can call everyone else to destroy the Guardians and calmly go down the tunnel,
just watch out for the mines.

	When you go down you'll quickly be attacked by a Moon but it's easy to slaughter
and once done, just go southeast until you reach Project Sunlight.  There's no artifacts to
grab and just a bunch of foes that try to ambush you in the tunnels, so there's not much reason
to explore them out.  So head straight for your objective and sit back as you watch the end
movie scroll.

ED MISSIONS COMPLETE!!!!

4.2		UNITED CIVILIZED STATES MISSIONS

	Unlike the other missions, you start off having to fight your way through to your
main base.  Eventually you'll get one but for the time being, you'll just have to do your
organization within the mission.  The early missions are probably the most difficult for the
UCS but once you get your main base-the rest of the missions aren't too hard but still more
challenging than those of the other factions.  You only have to fight the LC so gear
everything towards getting maximum performance against them.

*Technology not available for research include: Offensive Plasma Cannon, Shark, Hydra,
Orca, and SDI Laser

		MISSION 1

		FLORIDA

1) Florida

Base Given: 2 Power Plants, 4 Nuclear Reactors, 5 Power Transmitters, 4 Aerial Supply Depots,
	       2 SDI Defense Centers, 5 Fortresses, 2 Teleporters
Units Given: Assault 1, Assault 2, 6 Harvester IVs
Money Given: 20000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: Destroy ED base 25000 credits, Destroy LC base 25000 credits
Research:  Cannon 105mm, Double Cannon 105mm, upg. 105mm Bullets, upg. 105mm Bullets,
	     upg. 105mm Bullets, Unit Transporter, upg. Harvester, upg. Harvester II,
     upg. Harvester III, upg. Harvester IV, upg. Harvester V

	The President gives you a message concerning your counterattack against Project
Sunlight.  You are to take the two Assaults to the moon via the space port in Florida however
you must first collect 50000 credits to get the flight going.

	You first start off with the Assaults in the subterranean tunnels and must bring them to
the surface.  You must not never get them killed but they're almost indestructible and can often
win the day for you..

	Assault
	HP: 3600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 19
	Hard Point: 1 Heavy

	[The Assault is just a Grizzly with another name, but if you ever encountered a Grizzly
or used one before you'll know just how tough they are.  Assault 1 is carting the typical Heavy
Plasma Cannon upg.2 and a Plasma Cannon upg.1 combo found on the Grizzly, taking the
role of ground combat specialist.  Assault 2 has a unique combination of AA Plasma Cannon
upg.1 and modified Rocket Launcher (heavy) that has characteristics of the building version
rather than the vehicle one, it has some ground attack capability but excels in ground to air
defense.]

	As you bring them up, the President will soon inform you that the ED and LC have set up
bases in Florida and will try to prevent you from going to the space port.  If you destroy them,
25000 credits will be sent per each base destroyed.  Well it may seem like a lot, but believe me
the bonus means squat.  You don't retain anything for the next mission so it doesn't matter how
much money you have in the end.

	However if you want to go after the bases, here's some information.  The ED base is extremely
well protected with 6 artillery, 6 heavy towers, and 6 pillboxes in addition to having
their buildings equipped with chainguns and cannons.  The LC base has no defensive structures
or artillery save for the main base being outfitted with weapons.  What they do have is lots of
units including a number of them with electro-cannons.

	You can destroy both bases with just the Assaults but keep in mind that there's no way
to repair them currently and since you don't retain the money just splurge on lots of Tigers with
grenade launchers or double cannon 105mm with upgraded ammo.  First you should
manufacture a Condor and a Mammoth.  Have the Mammoth build 3 research centers and then
research every piece of technology available to you, especially Unit Transporter.  Once you've
researched Unit Transporter then build two of them.

	The Assaults should start pushing northwards, they'll come across a large number of
Pamirs with 105mm cannons in square formation.  Assault 1 can easily wipe them out.  When
they're gone move forwards and you'll see the ED mining operation.  Attack it and eventually
they'll send some Taigas with 20mm chainguns after you (it'll be laser cannons if you wait too
long).  Mop them up and as you go just a bit further, a group of Han armed with heavy rocket
launchers will attack you.  Assault 2 can destroy them with ease.  Now don't go any further,
just stay near the resource field and pick off any Gruz or other unit they send to recapture the
field.  The reason not to go any further is that the 6 artillery inflict devastating damage and
can easily kill a damaged Assault.  Instead, send in a Unit Transporter to pick up Assault 1
and place it just north of the ED base.  If it's night time, have the Assault shut off its lights
and launch rockets at the artillery from safe distance.  If it's day or you have somehow been
noticed, then quickly move the Assault west a bit.  The artillery will track the Assault but
when the fire, they'll end up hitting their own power plant and will easily destroy themselves
in the blast.  Now move Assault 1 upwards towards the entrance of the base.  Plant Assault 1
in front of the pillboxes but outside their firing range.  Assault 1 will be able to shoot them from
outside of their firing range.  The same thing goes for the heavy towers.  Without their artillery
and defensive structures, the rest of the ED base is a cakewalk.

	As for the LC base, the teleporter in your base is a shortcut there if you wish to use it.
Just teleport the Assaults, a Mammoth and as many Tigers as you can produce (don't expect
a lot, you have a very low unit limit this mission).  You will be encountering large waves of
Moons, Lunars and even some Thunderers with heavy rocket launchers so have the Mammoth
whip up a large number of small towers.  The LC units will end up dying against the concerted
firepower of your Assaults, Tigers and small towers.  Make sure to destroy the 3 mines the LC
have placed to limit how many units they can produce, in fact the LC will end up wasting a lot
of money as they try to put up new mines only to have you shoot them out of the air.  Eventually
the LC will run out of money and units making it an easy matter to wipe them out.

	By time you research everything, you'll have huge amounts of credits stored up.  Now
fly the Assaults to the north and have them go through one of the tunnels.  Then have them go
into the glowing area.  You'll soon be blasting off to the moon

		MISSION 2

		LANDING ZONE

2) Landing Zone

Base Given: None
Units Given: 2 Panthers with rocket launchers (small), 3 Tigers with plasma cannons
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  None

	The President informs you that your party got separated from the Assaults.  You'll have to
find them and eventually go to the LC base.

	Your map has the location of the Assaults but they're currently inactive and both are
guarded by a company of Moon m3s with rocket launchers.  Your current starting position is
under bombardment from a meteor shower (it's not the LC's doing, meteor showers are common
on the moon).  Leave the area and you'll find that the large crater nearby is an artifact site.
You'll need to regularly find artifact sites on this mission as you won't otherwise be able to restock
ammo and repair.  Also try not to get anyone killed as each death will severely hamper you.

	You'll soon be attacked by a group of Moons carrying rocket launchers, wipe them out
and use the artifact site.  Now go north to fetch Assault 1.  You'll encounter a Moon and Lunar
with double chainguns while another Moon is carrying an electro-cannon.  Wipe them out and
if you need to restock go back to the artifact site you found.  Continue going to where Assault 1
is and you'll encounter the Moons.  Wipe them out and Assault 1 will be under your control.
You'll notice that any experience earned in the Florida mission has disappeared, oh well.

	Now head south and make your way to where Assault 2.  You'll encounter more enemies
but Assault 1 will easily mop the floor with them.  Near Assault 2 is another artifact site,
use this to restock and repair anyone who needs it (the Panthers don't have a high ammo capacity
and will burn through ammo quickly).  Fight off the Moons and Assault 2 will be yours.

Now go to the northwest corner of the map.  The LC base is there and the President
will inform you that you must capture the AI subprocessor from the tunnels below the base.
While the units they send after you are weak, they have a Guardian and a couple of Defenders
to inflict some heavy damage on your units other than the Assaults.  So long as your Assaults aren't
ionized, they should easily wipe out the base and Assault 2 will be invaluable against the Meteors
that protect the base.  There's an artifact site to the west of the base,  so stock up and repair
before going down.

	The President mentioned to head east in the tunnels (what you're looking for is actually
in the northeast) and he's essentially correct.  Follow the tunnels eastwards and fight off enemy
units lurking here.  There's plenty of artifact sites, so repairs and reloads aren't an issue.  The
tunnels will eventually lead you to northeast where you will fight a single Crater guarding your
objective.  Go in and you've won this mission.

		MISSION 3

		THE MAILMAN

3) The Mailman
Base Given: None
Units Given: 3 Tigers with rocket launchers, 2 Tigers with Plasma Cannons, Cargo Salamander
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  None

	Neo I tells you to deliver the AI subprocessor to the meeting point.  Unfortunately he
doesn't know where it is!!!  He also tells you that it is in the Cargo Salamander so don't let it
get destroyed.

	Well your starting point has an artifact site with 4 repairs.  This is the only artifact site
on this mission and there's no way to reload (those stupid Tigers with rockets aren't going to
be much help).  To top it off your starting point is being hit by a constant meteor shower and
your Assaults start the mission in an extremely damaged state and lost all their experience.
So move Tigers forward to lessen the chance of getting plugged by a meteor and have the Assaults
repaired.  Get the Salamander out of there too.  Neo I may not know where the
meeting spot is but I do, it's in the southwest corner of the screen.

	Now as you move forwards you'll be attacked by a lot of enemies including some
very high powered ones such as Crushers and a Thunderer.  I made some wrong decisions
and ended up fighting everything on the map, I only lost a Tiger (actually it could have lived
had I paid better attention) but Assault I was hanging by a thread.

	To avoid this look for that junction that can either take you east or south.  If you go
east, you'll end up fighting a trio of Crushers with heavy rocket launchers and a squad of
Meteors plus the odd Moon.  If you continue east you'll end up fighting an entire LC base
that is very well protected with many Guardians and Defenders.  However if you go south
on that early junction and follow the road it'll take you through a number of fairly small fights
that the Assaults can easily win.

	Now eventually you'll wind up in a path with a trio of Fat Girls with rocket launchers.
Take them out and carry on to large junkyard that is under a heavy meteor shower.  You can
win through with only Assault 2 as all the opposition are aircraft.  You'll fight a Thunderer, a
lot of Super Fighters and Meteors but Assault 2's heavy armor and AA plasma cannon will
smash through all comers.  Look for a glowing landing zone and bring the Cargo Salamander
near it.  Neo I will congratulate you and take you to your main base (finally!!!).

		<INTERLUDE>

	Neo I will give you more information about what is really going on such as Golan I
being the real power behind the UCS.  Your job isn't just to destroy Project Sunlight but to
steal its plans as well.  For now let's take a well-deserved breather and get a tour of your
new home.

Starting Base: Main Base

	Unlike the other factions, the UCS base has everything in one single facility.  So no
more constantly pressing Q.  If you researched everything from Mission 1, you'll be in a good
starting position.   In your base there's a resource field worth 20000 credits to harvest so get to it.
Also your Assaults no longer lose all their experience, so you can expect them to be very
dominant on the battlefield.  Before you start Mission 4, you better construct some Unit
Transporters and Condors, then load up the Albatross with everyone you got.  If you still
need money you can sell off unessential buildings.  Don't worry about adding weapons to
buildings or making towers and fortresses-the LC will not attack your main base.  If you haven't
researched any of the available technology in Mission 1, you have the chance to do so now.

	Any credits from your accounts at the mission site will automatically be transferred to
the main base once you end a mission.

*Cargo Salamander is researched for free

	KAINIX gives us a detailed report on LC technology-it also mentions that Cargo
Salamander technology has been given to you, that there are power shield generators north
of your starting point and that since the Project Sunlight weapon is in outer space, you must
go after the power sources instead.

After that bit of briefing, I suggest that you get the Cargo Salamander out of there
and send it with your other units.  The Mammoth should be building a landing zone, power
plant and refinery to get things going.  Fly in your Albatross and unload it quickly because
you're going to be getting into fights soon.  Unfortunately the LC are taking you very seriously
because not only do they send the usual Meteors, Moons and Lunars but they'll be sending
Crushers as well.  Building some small towers can really help take the heat off of your troops,
especially if you've researched plasma cannons and AA plasma guns.  If you haven't already
done so, you had better research repairers because the LC attacks will be constant.

	Once you have you have some small towers set up, fly your Assaults north to pick up
the shields.  You'll get maximum shields and believe me you'll need them.  You might as well
have the Panthers get the remaining shields rather than let them go to waste.  Also have
someone with rocket launchers guard your resource field as the LC can place a mine there.

	Now there are two bases for the LC, one in the northeast and the other in the southeast.
If you move quickly you can take over at least a bit of the resource fields that belong to them.
As you go east, you'll see a fenced off area of what looks to be a junkyard.  KAINIX warns you
that it's an area of high radioactivity and to stay away from it.  Do what it says because the
radiation bypasses shields and armor to do damage directly to your unit and the radiation is so
strong that it will also harm aircraft in the sky.  There's a Guardian placed just outside the
radioactive area so watch that none of your aircraft accidentally stray into its firing range.

	I'd recommend destroying the base in the southeast first as it's the easier of the two
to deal with.  As you proceed to that base, you'll see a wall of Guardians blocking your path.
Assault 1 if equipped with shields, can mop the floor with them.  Have Assault 2 guard
Assault 1 from any enemy aircraft in the area while Assault 1 destroys the Guardians.
Once you clear the way, head straight for the mines.  The LC have a lot of mines going and
this is what's been funding the constant waves of enemies attacking your base.  Destroy
the mines and leave Assault 2 in the area to stop any attempts to replace the mines.  Have
Assault 1 go on the offensive and wipe out the base.  You'll find a tunnel entrance which if
you go down it has 10000 credits and can lead all the way to the northeast base.  But it might
be better not to take the tunnel all the way there, just grab the 10000 credits and return to the
surface.

	To take on the northeast base I'd recommend building a few Gargoyles with plasma
cannons.   Research the necessary technology to make the strongest level of Gargoyles with
plasma cannons m2 and then build them.  Now send the Assaults northwards to destroy another
wall of Guardians and do some damage to the northeast base.  This base has a couple of artillery
that can really pound your ground units, so pull back and let the Gargoyles fly in.  In addition
to the radiation zone you first encountered, there's one to the west of the northeast base so be
on the lookout for it.  You'll want to fly the Gargoyles in from where Assaults had cleared a path
because there's still a number of things with AA rocket launchers (the LC will now favor an AA
rocket launcher/electro-cannon tandem for their buildings).  Keep an eye out for those and start
destroying everything else.  Blow up the artillery and your Assaults can do the rest.  There's a
tunnel entrance here and it also has 10000 credits plus leads all the way to the southeast base.
Grab the credits and once the base is destroyed, Neo I will congratulate you on a job well done.
Harvest everything and sell your old facilities because we'll be heading to the next set of
missions.

			MISSION 5

			MARE PACIFIUM OR BETA-QUADRANT

	Now we get a choice between missions, I'd suggest going for Mare Pacifium first
because you can get some more relevant technology choices and some potent units.  You could do
BETA-Quadrant first but while the technology you can research looks impressive a lot
of them would be currently useless as you don't have the necessary complementary research.

5) Mare Pacifium

*Artillery is researched for free

	Neo I instructs you to test out the new LC artillery and wipe out the enemy base with it.
In this mission you can only call up reinforcements when you have destroyed all the enemy
buildings.

	You're going to be on your own and will have to survive on your own resources.
Plus by the time you're able to call in reinforcements, the enemy is already wiped out so
just work with what you have.

	The first thing is to organize your forces as you'll quickly be attacked from the front.
The biggest danger to your forces come from a Crater with a heavy electro-cannon and a pair
of Crushers with heavy rocket launchers.  Everything else is an annoyance but can be fairly
dangerous to your Tigers.  But your forces are strong enough to defeat anything with no
casualties so you won't need additional units.  Your current position is good enough to set up
a base and your artillery range is long enough to hit practically everywhere.

	The LC bases for you to destroy are located in the north, the east and the west of your
starting location.  I'd recommend building 2 artillery-one for the west and the other for the east.
Then later both can be aimed north to destroy that base.  So build a power plant and aerial supply
depot, then make the artillery.  I'd also recommend placing small towers in front of the artillery to
soak up enemy attacks that would otherwise hit your precious artillery and additionally set the
artillery to fire at will so they can land a first strike on any enemy attackers.  Because you'll face
several waves of LC units similar to the first attack you fought off.

	Since the mountains are blocking your view to the eastern and western LC bases, I'd
recommend sneaking a Condor over to act as a spotter for your artillery.  Be careful to avoid
enemy anti-aircraft missiles though.  The LC have their mines placed fairly far away from the
main line of Guardians and Defenders.  If you blow up what guards them, you'll clear a path
to the mines.  Then blast the mines into oblivion, this will mean more resources for you to gather
and the LC on this level do not replace lost buildings so they'll quickly run out of money to replace
lost units.

	Work on a few buildings that you have safely spotted with your Condors.  Now bring
them back as they'll eventually get too close to LC defensive line and will easily be shot down.
For a spotter, send a Tiger over to spot the enemy for a safe distance.   Before it'd be too
dangerous as the swift LC units would easily overtake and destroy your Tiger but their numbers
would be thinned out significantly by now as they get wiped out attacking your base and don't
have any funds to keep replacing everybody.  Eventually you can destroy everything in the
eastern and western bases.  Now as for the northern base, first send up a Condor to act as a
spotter but be careful of anti-aircraft missiles.  The Condor will also bait the guards into following
it back to your base.  With the guards destroyed, send a Tiger to act as spotter and bombard
the northern base into oblivion.  You can now build a landing zone and call in the Albatross.
Just bring in some harvesters and mine out all the available resources.


			MISSION 6

* note that whichever mission you do you now get to research Power Shield Generator 1800
PSU, Rocket Launcher, Panther, upg. Panther I, upg. Panther II

	At first you start off with a powerful base but it's going to be destroyed by a massive
meteor shower almost instantly.  So sell everything off and pull the units given to you out of
harm's way.  You'll probably only come out with a few survivors and a couple of credits.
However a distant landing zone was spared the destruction so everything will be alright.

	The President informs you that the meteor shower was brought about by the
LC's weather control centers.  You have a limited amount of time before they launch
another strike on your location.

	Well call up the Albatross and time to get to work, the President was nice enough
to show the locations of the weather control centers on the map.  The first location is just
north of your destroyed base while the other one is far to the south.  You can simply build
artillery to blow up the northern location while you send the Assaults or other strong units
to destroy the southern ones-the LC resistantance isn't very fierce.  There's a nice resource
field near your destroyed base and considering the types of technology you can develop,
this will be handy.  Don't worry the LC aren't aggressive on this level as they're relying on
a meteor shower to wipe you out.  They'll only attack if you attack them first.

	Also you can capture enemy units now but you need a building grabber first
and an enemy building  with either electro-cannons or ion cannons.  First research the building
grabber, then look for a suitable building and place it under your control with the building
grabber.  Then lure an enemy unit to your captured building where it will be attacked by
the building's electro-cannons.  Have a repairer ready as soon as the enemy has been
shocked and you can then place it under your control.  I got a couple of Crushers and
later a bunch of Crions out of  this method but it's quite a bit of work and you may end up
just selling your captured units (the LC rarely outfit Crushers with shields and keep in mind
though that the only real place to pick up some shield projectors is on Mission 11-Mission 9
has a lot but it's a special case that really won't help here.  Crions are always good value to
pick up and will be commonly found with shields.)

	With the destruction of the weather control centers, the President will give you orders
to destroy all the LC bases.   The LC are still very docile but they'll try to mine your resource
field so put some units or small towers to shoot down any incoming mines.  Well turnabout
is fair play, so if you had just destroyed the southern weather control centers there are bases
to the southeast and southwest corners.  Go in and destroy their mines and work over their
bases a little, there should be plenty of resources left to mine.  Don't bother using the tunnel
entrances as there's nothing in them save that they connect to each of the LC bases but
it takes a long time to navigate through them and they'll put you directly in the line of fire.

	As you probably saw on your way to the south, there are areas of strong radiation
on this mission.  Avoid cutting through them but make sure to check for LC presence in the
vicinity.  A couple of LC buildings are located near them.  The 3 bases of the LC are located
in the southwest, southeast and northeast with a number of buildings scattered around plus
radioactive hotspots.  The southwest location has a pair of artillery while the northeast
location is full of enemy units especially of the flying variety.

	Considering that you have artillery, the Assaults and some Jaguars this mission should
be a piece of cake.  This mission is mainly for harvesting resources and getting a lot of research
done.  To finish this mission, make sure to destroy every LC building that belongs to a base-it
can be pretty easy to miss one.  I'd recommend keeping just your Assaults and the Jaguars
(make sure to give them some shields) and sell every other ground combat unit off to free up
the unit limit.  Harvest all the resources, finish whatever technology catches your fancy and
load up the Albatross for the next mission.

			MISSION 7

			DEATH CANYON

7) Death Canyon
Base Given: None
Units Given: 2 Panthers with rocket launchers, 2 Jaguars with Heavy Plasma Cannons,
       Mammoth
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  upg. Heavy Plasma Cannons II, upg. Rocket Launchers I, upg. Rocket Launchers II,
	     upg. Heavy Rockets (guided 50%), upg. Heavy Rockets (guided 100%), Bomber
	     Rocket Launcher, upg. Bomber Rocket Launcher, Jaguar, upg. Jaguar I, Minelayer,
	     upg. Minelayer, Bat

	ARES XIV informs you that you cannot proceed any further unless you take control of
the rock bridges and wipe out all LC resistance.  So better do as it says.

	This mission is a piece of cake as the LC doesn't have a lot of units and they're fairly
passive.  To top it off, you can produce Jaguars and the most powerful heavy weapons on this
level.  So time to make some room for the heavy firepower.  The only thing special about this
level is the introduction of Crions by the LC.

	First build a landing zone and get some buildings started up like towers with AA plasma
guns.  Now there's a squad of Thunderers plus some Moons up north as well as a dried out LC
mine.  If you push too far north the enemy will come after you, then pull back or you might get
shot at by a Crion.  Lead the Thunderers into some waiting AA plasma and rocket fire.  Now
to the west of where you started is a resource field that has been untouched.  Go and harvest
it but be warned that if you do the LC will send some cheap ground units to attack from the
west of the resource field.

	If you have developed upgraded heavy grenade launchers then it's easy to wipe out
everything.  Each of the rock bridges has a Guardian and some Defenders, each one also
has a Crion except for the centre bridge which has two.  Since heavy grenade launchers outrange
a Crion plasma cannon, just send a spotter for your grenade launchers to bombard the Crions.
With them safely out of the way, you can easily bombard enemy buildings from a safe distance
because they have no artillery.  Just make sure to back up your grenade launchers with rockets
or AA plasma guns in case of attacks from the sky.

	If you're up for a challenge, you can even try to capture a Crion or two though it's going
to be somewhat dangerous.  Here's my method of doing so-first get a Unit Transporter to grab
the Crion and move it aside.  Next capture one of the enemy's buildings that has an electro-cannon
(best to have more than one nearby building captured-because otherwise the Crion will recover too
quickly for you to readily shock).  Now build a shadow generator near the captured building(s) and
make a ring of your own units with at least one with a repairer.  The Crion will be confused by your
cloaked units and not a fire a shot while being zapped by your building's electro-cannons.  Just make
sure to make your buildings fire at other targets once the Crion is shocked as you don't want to
accidentally blow it up.  The repair unit should soon be able to convert the Crion to your cause.

	The LC base is located in the northwest corned of the map and is going to be a sitting
duck on this easy mission.  So just harvest away and do whatever research you want.

			MISSION 8

			GAMMA-QUADRANT

8) GAMMA-Quadrant
Base Given: None
Units Given: 5 Panthers with rocket launchers (small), 5 Tigers with Plasma Cannons,
       1 Grizzly III with heavy plasma cannons, 1 Grizzly III with heavy rocket
       launchers, Mammoth
Money Given: 15000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  Fortress, upg. Shadow Generator I, upg. Bat

	ARES XIV informs you that they had misunderstood the nature of the Sunlight weapon.
It turns out that the power plants on the ground were mostly for backup.  In any event you should
take them out anyway.

	Woo hoo!  Some Grizzlies to match your Assaults, now that's heavy firepower!  You
might as well recycle the rest of the bunch as they're only taking up space.  Now time to build
a landing zone and get the Albatross down.  It'd also be nice to outfit the Grizzlies with strong
shields.  There's a resource field to the east and west of your starting location, since the LC
aren't aggressive in this level you can harvest them with little danger.

	Grizzly III
	HP: 3600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 19
	Hard Point: 1 Heavy

	[In case you haven't played the ED or LC missions yet, the Grizzly is the unit the
Assault is based on.  However unlike the Assault, the Grizzly is expendable.  Still trying
to blow one up isn't too easy as it's the toughest unit in the game and carries a great deal
of firepower as it always uses a heavy weapon and a submount combo.  Typically it carries
a heavy plasma cannon and plasma cannon for ground-pounding or else a rocket launcher
and small rocket launcher combo for air and ground targets]

	Now to destroy the enemy bases you must push north along that narrow canyon.
There's going to be a number of Crushers with heavy rocket launchers nearby, as well as
some Lunars and Moons.  ln the middle of the canyon is a Guardian but rather than destroying
it why not make it a shot blocker for your forces?  First take out the Crushers guarding it,
then send a building grabber to nab it.  As you do so the LC will try to place a Defender nearby
and will send a pack of Crushers, Lunars and Moons to destroy your Guardian.  So send your
units to block off the enemy attackers and grab the Defender that just came down.

	When you've defeated the enemy, there's a radiation zone at the end of the canyon.
There's also a series of enemy aircraft nearby that's waiting to attack anyone going too close
to them.  I'd recommend calling up all your units capable of rocket or AA plasma fire to cluster
around your Guardian and Defender.  Next fly one of your aircraft past the mountains east of
the your two LC buildings.  Eventually you'll get the attentions of a bunch of enemy aircraft so
lead them back to the rest of your army where they'll get shot down.  Now fly your aircraft past
the radiation zone to lead the enemy aircraft there back to the rest of your troops in the canyon.
Once you've cleared out the enemy aircraft, go look for enemy Crions.  There's five altogether
for this particular base-2 are in the northern section, 2 in the central area and the last one is
lurking amongst the power plants.

	Bring your heavy grenade launchers to blast the Crions into smithereens (if you don't
feel it might be worthwhile to try and capture them).  Now there's just the base itself to contend
with.  The Guardians and Defenders are no match for all the forces you've gathered, so blow
up whatever you want.  There should still be a lot of resources in the area that the mines haven't
depleted but you'll get plenty of credits from the two resource fields under your control so taking
out the mines as a priority is up to you.  There's a tunnel entrance on this base that you might
want to check out.  You will be told to pick up an information terminal about Sunlight from these
tunnels.

	Now while this tunnel system connects to every base in this level, I wouldn't recommend
using the tunnels to access them.  They lead directly into a big line of Guardians and Defenders
surrounding the tunnel entrances.  Instead explore the tunnel system, there's 20000 credits to be
had as well as the information console that you're supposed to pick up.  When you've searched
everything out, return to the surface.

	It doesn't matter which base you go after next as they're all largely the same, in my
game I went after the southeast base.  You'll encounter some Craters, Crions and Moons in
addition to Super Fighters and Meteors.  Take them out and work on the Guardians and
Defenders protecting this base.  Pretty soon you'll have destroyed another base.  After
destroying this go and take out the northeast and northwest base.  You'll soon be done

			MISSION 9

			INVISIBLE ENEMY

9) Invisible Enemy
Base Given: None
Units Given: Jaguar with Heavy Plasma Cannons, 3 Panthers with rocket launchers,
       3 Tigers with Rocket Launchers, 3 Tigers with Plasma Cannons
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: upg. Shadow Generator II, Bomb Bay, Dragon, upg. Dragon


	Neo I informs you that the LC has been tinkering with alien technology and
have rendered their base invisible to your scanners.  You're job is to knockout the
power plants that power this "hiding cap".

	Unfortunately, this mission is a throwback to your early ones where you have
no support or construction capacity.  So be wary of squandering ammo and taking
too much damage as there's only a few spots to reload and repair.  The enemy you
face aren't initially equipped with shields, so your units with plasma cannons can make
short work out of them.  You'll be facing Moons with chainguns, Moons with electro-cannons,
Lunars with rocket launchers, Craters with heavy electro-cannons and a single Crater
with a heavy rocket launcher.  I found the Jaguar you get to be the most important unit
in this mission, all your other units are either too fragile or have too little ammo to stand
up in this fight (your units and their equipment have not been upgraded except for the
Jaguar's guns).  Also the tunnels on this level are very narrow so if you're caught in a fight
try to move to a place with more open space so you don't wind up blocking your own guys.

	Now take your troops down the tunnel entrance in front of you.  Your first priority
is to get your hands on some shield generators.  There's an artifact site to the northeast
of the tunnel entrance.  It's got energy recharges, repair and ammo.  Keep that in mind
as it's going to be important as you progress through this mission.

	Now to your northeast is a few shield generators, unfortunately it's guarded by
Moons and Lunars who just might end up taking the shields before you can reach them.
Make sure to rush in and you should be able to grab one or two (don't worry there's plenty
of shields in this mission).   Going east after this will take you to a corridor with some niches.
One niche has a repair while another one has ammo.

Further to your east will lead you to an area that has a corridor with some shields
unfortunately it's bait for an ambush by a series of Moons who are likely to grab them before
you do, but you should still be able to pick a shield generator up.  If you go southwest you'll
find a plentiful supply of shields unfortunately it's guarded by 2 Craters and some Moons.

	The majority of the shields are located in the western part of the tunnel system with
one exception.  In the northeast corner is an area with a lot of shields and it's only guarded
by Lunars and Moons that aren't very aggressive, so if you still need shields that's the place
to go.

	The area you wish to go to is in the southeast corner, that's where the tunnel entrance
is located which will lead you to the power plants.  To reach this area, you'll have to watch out
for rooms that have enemies in them (fortunately none of these rooms have shield generators,
so your foes can't grab a shield).  When you beat them off you'll eventually fin a corridor that
has a niche with ammo.  If you're badly hurt, then go back all the way and get some repair done
especially if your Jaguar's in bad shape.  Once done just go into the huge room where the
tunnel entrance is located, there's a pair of Lunars guarding it but they'll be a snap to destroy.

	Now one warning before you go up, there's a couple of units lurking up there that are
just waiting to ambush you.  They include a pair of Moons with electro-cannons, a Crater with
heavy electro-cannons and the Crater with a heavy rocket launcher I mentioned.  Send up
the Jaguar to break through them and when the rest of your team follows they should have no
problems taking them out.  There's only a pair of Defenders with chainguns protecting this area
so destroying all the power plants will be easy work.  Once done, you'll get a message telling
you the mission has been completed.  Say good bye to the squad you just used, they're not
coming along for the ride.

			MISSION 10

			DELTA QUADRANT

10) Delta Quadrant
Base Given: None
Units Given: Mammoth, 4 Panthers with rocket launchers (small),
       4 Tigers with Plasma Cannons
Money Given: 20000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: upg. Shadow Generator III, upg. Bomb Bay, upg. Plasma Bomb,
	    upg. Plasma Bomb, upg. Plasma Bomb

	Neo tells you all kinds of gibberish involving how the UCS has captured and
interrogated someone from the LC.  Basically he informs you to destroy the Delta Quadrant.

	You've probably used up all of your unit limit so you might want to think about scrapping
some units that aren't all that essential (for example if you've captured some Crions, then you
might want to dump a few Jaguars or Panthers that carry Heavy Grenade Launchers).  This might
be an attractive prospect as you can now research powerful bombers and all-purpose attack
aircraft.  Also this stage is the last one for new research, your technology tops out here.

	Just northeast of where your initial troops are, is a large resource field.  This is a good
spot to set up your base, not only because of the resource field but because the area is easily
defendable.  Believe me when you do get the base going make sure to load up on the defense
and call up the Albatross which should be stocked with powerful units like the Grizzly or Assault.
This time the LC are going on the offensive.  You'll face heavy attack from the skies and ground
by small numbers of powerful units like Thunderers, Crushers and Crions that come in quick
waves rather than being swarmed by legions of weak units.  Initially the Crushers and Craters
are unshielded but later on the LC will produce them with shields.  The attacks will be coming
from the west so place your fortresses, artillery and towers accordingly.  You might want to
have some Unit Transporters ready to grab some enemy units for some conversion opportunities.
When things have settled down, there are three LC bases to destroy.

	Now if you look at where the attacks are coming from, there's a narrow path through
the mountains.  While aircraft can easily go over the mountains, ground units will have to either
go through a tunnel system or take the path.  Follow it and you should find a pair of Crushers
and a pair of Moons, take them out and further on is a Guardian with a couple of Thunderers.
The Thunderers are still on the ground and can easily be destroyed by attacks from your
ground units.

	Next a trio of artillery will be on the lookout for attackers but these are easy to deal
with.  Once they're gone. it's time to systematically wipe out the base.  You should be able to
destroy the LC base early enough to prevent them from mining out the entire resource field
here.   The LC will then spend ridiculous amounts of credits trying to rebuild their base,
constantly landing buildings that are just going to be target practice for your troops.  There's
a tunnel entrance which can lead to all the rest of the LC bases.  The system of tunnels have
nothing of value, the only things of interest being a number of weak units that you can beat
up for experience.  You can reach the other bases from here but the tunnels will lead you
right where their artillery will pound on you.  I'd suggest going either for the base directly
south or to the base in the southeast.  Keep an eye out for radiation zones, the bases are
largely identical to the one you first destroyed so you'll know what to expect.  Once you
destroy your second base (doesn't matter which) there is a path that leads to the your final
base.  Destroy this last base and we're off to the last UCS mission!

			MISSION 11

			EXECUTION

11) Execution
Base Given: Landing Zone
Units Given: 5 Gargoyles II with plasma cannons m2, Jaguar with heavy plasma cannons,
	       Jaguar with rocket launchers.
Money Given: 30000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: None

	You're mission is to prevent the LC from firing their weapon at the UCS on Earth.
They're low on energy but have enough charge to get one devastating shot off.  You must
destroy the 4 control centers for the weapon but they are currently protected by a powerful
regeneration system.  So you must first deactivate the regeneration system in order to deal
permanent damage to the control centers.

	You start off with the 2 Jaguars and a trio of Gargoyles guarding your landing
zone.  To your right and left are resource fields, both of which are guarded by your
remaining Gargoyles.  There are 2 force field projectors right behind the Jaguars for any
units that need them.

	Now enemy units will be sent to destroy your landing zone or else Super Fighters
will aim to destroy the Albatross if it's around.  So make sure to fly in your forces as soon
a the mission begins.  Upgrade the Jaguars you've been provided with and keep the enemy
from grabbing the shields.  Build a lot of fortresses and towers to keep the enemy from
destroying your base.  Don't worry about the resource fields yet, the LC will typically
concentrate on destroying your base first.  Just send the Albatross to get credits from
your main base for time being, when things are less hectic then you should go for the
resource fields.

	There are tunnel entrances near both resource fields.  Go down them and head
north. There are 4 niches which holds the switches for the regeneration system.  Touch
them to deactivate each one.  Other than that there's nothing else of interest except for
ammo and a number of enemy units.

	You can now go north to lay siege to the control centers, be warned that this time the
LC will be using Phobos carrying detectors so they can detect cloaked units at long distances.
The control centers are located in a mountainous crater which can only be entered by aircraft.
The regeneration system may be turned off but the control centers are still indestructible.  You
must first destroy the xyrex power plants inside the crater which will then leave the control
centers vulnerable to attack.  There are four LC bases protecting the crater, 2 below and the
others to the right and left of it.  Unless you're in a bloodthirsty mood, you can just avoid them.

	If you have a lot of bombers, Gargoyles, and some type of aircraft with heavy rockets
just fly them into the crater and wreak havoc.  A couple of Super Fighters will try to challenge
you but your heavy rockets should be able to pick them off before they do any harm.  If you
lack a strong air force, you'll have to use transporters to fly in ground units or build some
towers and fortresses inside the crater.  Take out the power plants then work on the control
centers.  Once you destroy the 4 control centers then Project Sunlight will go up in flames
as well.  Just sit back and enjoy the movie

			UCS MISSIONS COMPLETE!!!!

4.3			LUNAR CORPORATION MISSIONS

	The LC missions are probably amongst the easiest in the game but the LC have
certain glaring disadvantages (no repairer technology, lack of energy during night or
heavy cloud cover and etc.) that you'll have to compensate for.  Keep in mind that your
only opposition is the UCS, so play to your considerable and unique strengths while taking
advantage of their weaknesses.  Since there's two main events happening at once, the LC
missions branch off in a more different manner than those of the other two.

	You are alerted that the UCS are attacking.  The LC council believe you are the
best hope for repelling this invasion.  The council informs you that any money you pick up
will automatically be sent to Luna 1 after you end a mission.

	Looking at what you've been given, you'll notice an obscene amount of waste going
into the bases.  Unfortunately you are not allowed to sell any LC buildings, so you'll just have
to bear with it.  Unlike the other factions, the LC have not provided you with any starting units
but there's really no reason to build any right now.  You have a mine in the main base that is
located on a fairly rich resource field, so the lack of any starting money isn't going to be a
problem.  The only thing to do is have some research done once your supply of credits build
up.  Now on to the first mission

*Technology not available for research include: Sonic Cannon, Heavy Sonic Cannon, Air
Sonic Cannon, and SDI Laser

			MISSION 1

			INVASION

1) Invasion
Base Given: 2 NESTs, 2 Research Centers, 2 Solar Power Plants, 20 Solar Cells, 3 Solar
	       Batteries, 1 Aerial Supply Center, 1 Main Base
Units Given: 5 Fat Girl c4s with electro-cannon upg.1, 2 Mercuries, Phobos with detector
Money Given: 20000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  Moon m2, Moon m3, Fat Girl c3, Fat Girl c4, electro-cannon upg.1,
	     Power Shield Generator 1000 PSU

*Fat Girl c2 and Electro-Cannon are researched for free

	You are alerted to a UCS attack on this area.  You are told that the UCS have new
unit designs including the Cargo Salamander and the powerful Grizzly.  The LC scientist will
loan you the Fat Girl prototypes which should be enough to stop the invasion.

	First off, the UCS attack will take place in the northeast corner of the map.  The LC
base there starts off at only a fraction of its normal durability so the UCS will wipe the place
out with no casualties.  They'll then establish a base and build up its forces to attack the
base where you start from.  The invasion force is comprised of a Mammoth, a Grizzly with
heavy plasma cannons, a Grizzly with heavy rockets, 11 Spiders with plasma cannons, 3
Tigers with plasma cannons and 4 Tigers with repairers.  The report was erroneous about
the Cargo Salamanders but if you wait too long to deal with the UCS, they'll build a fleet
of Cargo Salamanders and Tigers with grenade launchers so take them out quickly.

	Grizzly III
	HP: 3600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 19
	Hard Point: 1 Heavy

	[In case you haven't played the ED or UCS missions yet, the Grizzly is the toughest
unit in the game, moves quickly and carries a great deal of firepower as it always uses a
heavy weapon and a submount combo.  Typically it carries a heavy plasma cannon and
plasma cannon for ground-pounding or else a rocket launcher and small rocket launcher
combo for air and ground targets]

	Now to the southeast of the map is your Phobos that is watching a resource field.
Place a mine in the region and gather the Fat Girls.  The Fat Girls are more than enough
to destroy the unshielded UCS forces, in fact they're good enough to be a workhorse for
all your missions.  But before attacking the UCS you'll want to make a small detour.

	In the middle of the map is a crater with 2 research centers.  This area is a very
extensive artifact site that even includes 6 shield generators.  You'll need those in order
to survive against all the plasma attacks the UCS will use on you.  The crater and the area
surrounding it is under constant meteor showers, so grab the shields and leave quickly.

	Now you can approach the UCS base directly from the south or you can attack
them from the west.  I'd recommend the west because the UCS forces are moving south,
this will leave their base unattended and you can quickly destroy the buildings and
non-combat units here.  The UCS forces will return back to their base but by the time
they do, you'll have already wiped out most of the base and accumulated some solid
experience.  Now wipe out the enemy forces and remaining buildings.  The scientist
thanks you by officially giving you the 5 Fat Girls.  I'd recommend building a Fat Girl c4
with maxed out rocket launchers, have it grab the remaining shield and destroy any
Condors that the UCS might have built.  That way you don't waste a shield, now finish
mining all remaining resources and leave.

			MISSION 2

			CARPATES OR CONVOY

	Doing the Carpates mission leads to the Shower mission while the Convoy
mission leads to the 1st Ring mission.  The Convoy mission becomes much easier
if you do Carpates first.

2) Carpates
Base Given: None
Units Given: 4 Unit Transporters
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: none
Research:  none

*Unit Transporter researched for free

	You are told that some Unit Transporters have accidentally stumbled on a UCS base.
The base must be destroyed but before a landing zone can be built, the enemy Harvesters
must be destroyed.  Use the Unit Transporters to destroy them.

	At the top of the screen is a count of how many Harvesters are remaining.  You must
use your Transporters to grab a Harvester and drop it to its doom.  Now you can kill two birds
with one stone by grabbing a Harvester and dropping it on a tower or another Harvester.
Initially the UCS won't know about your Transporters but as you start destroying Harvesters,
they'll eventually send Spiders with small rocket launchers to shoot you down.  To avoid this,
fly to northwest corner of the screen which leads to a canyon.  The Spiders can't follow you
in there and will eventually leave.  Don't worry about trying to prevent the Harvesters from
mining, this mission prevents you from building anything other than a landing zone so it doesn't
matter.  Just keep destroying Harvesters at your convenience and with the last one gone, you
are given clearance to build a landing zone.  The Fat Girls you got in the first mission are more
than powerful enough to destroy everything on this level so you don't need to build any units
at the main base.

	When your troops arrive, first destroy the refineries and supporting buildings.  Next
go southwest which holds the real UCS base.  There's nothing that can really threaten you
so just level anything that gets in your way until you finish this mission.  This mission opens
a path to the mission Shower

			MISSION 3

			CARPATES OR CONVOY

3) Convoy
Base Given: 4 Defenders, 8 Solar Power Plants, 72 Solar Cells, 8 Solar Batteries,
       1 Main Base,
Units Given: 6 Fat Girl c4s with electro-cannon upg.1, 6 Phobos with detector
Money Given: 20000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: 2000 credits and keep the Fat Girls if all survive
Research:  Shield Recharger, Shield Recharger m2

	You are told that you are assigned to escort a convoy to an LC base.  Unfortunately
the UCS have mined the area you are to cross and the convoy drivers lack the experience
to avoid the mines.  You must bring back at least 4 Fat Girls or the mission is scrubbed.

	This is a nasty mission in terms of being tedious unless you did the Carpates mission
first.  Now there's no hostile units on this level but there's certainly plenty of mines.  The Fat
Girls have a nasty habit of taking routes that lead straight into them, unfortunately the mines
here will not be destroyed if something runs into them so you can lose your entire convoy.

	You're given 6 Phobos to help act as spotters but they're next to useless as they're
too primitive to see very far and there's a lot of land to cover.  Also there isn't that much time
before the Fat Girls begin their trek to the base.

	The first thing you must do is drop down a fence to keep the Fat Girls from moving
anywhere.  This is the only way you're going to have enough time to do anything.  Now if you've
done the Carpates mission, you can build Unit Transporters.  Since there's no Landing Zone
and you can't build any buildings other than laser walls but the Main Base provided to you can
build the units you need.  A single Unit Transporter is all you need to get all the Fat Girls safely
to the base.  If you didn't do Carpates, things get a lot harder.

	Since laser walls cannot self-destruct, you'll need to build a unit with weapons to destroy
any laser walls that have been badly placed.  Screwing up when making a line of laser walls is
very common since they're clumsy to set up and they only generate lasers when the wall is
initially built.  You can't simply attach a new, single laser wall to an old one to fill in a gap,
you have to make a line from scratch.  To make matters worse, a number of the mines are placed in such
a manner that you can't block them off without blocking the entire passage.  Additionally the Fat
Girls can sometimes get stuck permanently when they find the path they're looking for is blocked
off.  The only thing you can do is sweep the area for mines and fence them off as best you can.
Once you're satisfied with the results, destroy the laser wall that is keeping the Fat Girls penned
in and occasionally use your unit to run some interference if a Fat Girl is getting dangerously
close to an mine that isn't walled off.  I considered myself lucky to get through with two Fat Girls
destroyed when I did this level without using Unit Transporters.

	Still this mission isn't a necessary one and if you fail it, the game doesn't end.  If you
keep all 6 Fat Girls alive, they'll put 2000 credits to the current mission account, you'll be allowed
to build a landing zone and the Fat Girls will be under your control.  Finishing this mission leads
to the 1st Ring mission.

			MISSION 4

			THE SHOWER OR 1ST RING

	While you can do these missions as soon as you get them, I'd recommend doing the
Carpates and Convoy mission first so that their technology is available to you if you need it.
Also from here on these missions allow you to sell buildings that you made or were given.

The Shower is the first mission where you meet your special unit Fang.  You'd
probably be better off starting with The Shower and getting the Fang as a permanent member
of your troops before tackling the missions from the 1st Ring branch.  Technology gained from
the Ring missions aren't of much use in the Fang scenarios as those missions rarely allow you
to build or fly in anything.

4) The Shower
Base Given: None
Units Given: Fang, 3 Craters m3 with heavy electro-cannon upg.1, 3 Super Fighters m2 with
       AA Rocket Launcher
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research:  Air Rocket Launcher, Air Rocket Launcher upg.1, Super Fighter m2

*Super Fighter and AA Rocket Launcher are researched for free and because you did
the Carpates mission you can research: upg: Air Chaingun, Meteor, Meteor m2, Meteor m3

	You are told that Fang has come up with new weapon system for the LC.  You
are to test it out on enemy bases in the region.  A countdown is done and then meteors
will be targeted in the region where the Fang is however it doesn't work if the Fang is
underground.

	Right next to where you start is an artifact site which includes four shield projectors.
The Fang should pick one up immediately and the other 3 can be given to either the Super
Fighters or the Craters.  After that the Fang should get moving to the northeast

	Fang
	HP: 600
	Shield: 0
	Armor: 75%
	Speed: about 32
	Hard Points: Special
	Ammo: 20
	Range: 7

	[If you've finished the ED missions, you'll find out that the Fang is identical to the
PROTOTYPES you encountered on the Africa mission.  The Fang is essentially a New Hope
that has been pumped up with lots of power.  It now has a lot of durability, increased speed,
can mount the strongest shield projector and the plasma beam mounted on it is a powerful weapon
that does 125 damage with improved range and ammo capacity.  With all these
abilities, without a doubt the Fang is one of the most powerful units in the game.  Keep in
mind that the Fang must never be destroyed in his special missions or else it's game over.
Also the regeneration ability isn't as good as that of the New Hope, the Fang recovers 3 HP
per second]

	While you head north, you'll be attacked by UCS patrols.  The Spiders are no match
for the mighty Fang, unfortunately the Gargoyles are another matter.  Scramble your Super
Fighters to destroy them, since the Gargoyles are carrying plasma cannons or chainguns
they don't retaliate well against the Super Fighters.  Always keep an eye on the clock, as soon
as time runs out a meteor shower begins.  Pull the Fang out and when the shower ends,
a new countdown begins.  You can use the Craters to assist the Fang but he's powerful
enough to not need the help, besides you don't want the Craters caught in the meteor
shower.  Still the Craters can really useful as the UCS have a large number of ground units
including Cargo Salamanders.

	Between the Fang and the meteor shower, no matter how well protected the base it
will soon be destroyed.  Now you can take the tunnel entrance below if it wasn't destroyed
but there's nothing there but a bunch of Tigers and Spiders and a pathway to the other base.
If you are ever low on energy to your weapons and shields, not to worry both bases have artifact
site that will replenish your energy completely.

	When the northeast base is destroyed, you should head to the southwest base or
vice-versa if you switched the order.  Again you'll have to contend another batch of Gargoyles
and a horde of Cargo Salamanders with a few Tigers.  You'll easily slaughter them, so proceed
to the base and systematically destroy it.  Make sure to destroy any building that you might have
overlooked and the mission will be over.  Unfortunately the Fang and the supporting units will
not be joining you.  Finishing this level will lead to the mission Under Fire

			MISSION 5

			THE SHOWER OR THE 1ST RING

5) The 1st Ring
Base Given: None
Units Given: 3 Craters m3 with Heavy Rocket Launcher upg.2, 3 Lunars m3 with Rocket
     Launcher upg.2
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: NEST, Defender, Power Shield Generator 1500 PSU, Regenerator,
    Regenerator m2, Regenerator m3, Building Grabber, Detector, Detector m2

*Xyrex Power Plant is researched for free and if you did the Carpates mission before this,
you can research: upg: Air Chaingun, Meteor, Meteor m2, Meteor m3

	You are told that the UCS have captured the Alpha Quadrant.  You are to remove
their presence from the area so that work can begin on Project Sunlight.

	First thing is to mine the resource field near you.  Now call in your Jupiter and bring
in some strong troops.  Hopefully you have some Super Fighters built as there's going to be
a lot of Gargoyles.  Your Fat Girls if they're still around will be more than enough to handle
the enemy ground units.  There are also resource fields in the northwest and southeast so
a lack of credits is not going to be a concern.  When you bring down the Jupiter make sure
you leave it at the mission site before you go too far east, otherwise your units will be stranded
at the end of this mission.  Also if you did all the missions involving Fang you can bring him
and the other units from the Deadly Toys mission, which should make this mission much easier.

	With your troops brought down, head east and you'll encounter an UCS base.  You
are then told that the your Transporter has been damaged can not be used to shuttle in new
troops.  You'll have to build everything on site but you're told that there are craters in the
northeast and southeast where resource fields are located.  You are commanded to build
a mine and 2 Platinum power plants in each crater.  What they mean by Platinum power plant
is a Xyrex power plant.  You now have the technology to build them.

	Once this base is destroyed, continue eastwards.  There you'll see a resource field
surrounded by a series of refineries and 4 shadow towers.  To make matters worse Gargoyles
plus a horde of ground units will come to swarm you.  Fight them off and destroy the shadow
towers.  This will reveal a horde of harvesters that you'll want to destroy.  Wipe out this whole
area and it will be the site of your base.

	Now you can easily push north or south and destroy the bases there.  Each base has a
tunnel system to allow you to reach either base but outside of a few guards, there's nothing
else of interest underground.  This will be the case in all Ring missions.  Now both areas
have craters which are surrounded by heavy towers.  The towers will prevent you from placing
any buildings inside the craters, so destroy the towers once you wipe out the bases.  You'll
now be able to place the mines and Xyrex power plants to complete the mission.  Just stick
around to mine out all the resources before leaving.  You can now proceed to the mission
The 2nd Ring

			MISSION 6

			UNDER FIRE OR THE 2ND RING

6) Under Fire
Base Given: 2 Solar Power Plants, 20 Solar Cells, 3 Solar Batteries, 3 Mines, 1 Main Base
Units Given: Fang, 2 Crushers m3 with Heavy Rocket Launcher upg. 2, 2 Super Fighters m2
     with AA Rocket Launchers
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: None

	Fang tells you that the UCS have begun a counter-attack on his position.  You must
get him to reach a northwestern base where some inactive Unit Transporters are.  Use them
to destroy the UCS artillery base and drive out the UCS from the area.  And as he says this
artillery fire descends upon your base.

	First thing to do is to sell off every building you have around the resource field.  The
artillery will wipe them out anyways so you might as well net some kind of profit.  Now the
artillery fire is coming directly north of you, there's a small camp that's loaded with artillery
and heavy towers with chainguns.   To your south is an artifact site with about 9 shield
projectors.  Send your units to the south to pick them up.  There's also a column of Cargo
Salamanders and Tigers heading your way.  Make sure to grab the shields first as the enemy
is loaded with plasma cannons.  There's also a Panther amongst them and you'll want to lure
it away from the shields.  If you did some or all of the Ring missions, the technology from them
is available for you to exploit.

	Once you take them out, there's a tunnel entrance in the middle of the map.  Take Fang
there and use the entrance to descend underground.  You might encounter a large number of
enemy units so be careful to avoid them as they sometimes include Jaguars with heavy plasma
cannons.  Make your way to a tunnel entrance in the east and head back to the surface.  Now
go north across a bridge that has two energy recharge artifacts and you're on your way to the
Transporters.  When you reach them, Fang will inform you that they are ready for action.  Sell
the buildings here as the enemy will eventually attack this area.  Move Fang and the Transporters
out of there.

	Now by this time the UCS will have sent Harvesters and a Cargo Salamander escort
to where your resource field is.  You can wipe them out with a combination of your combat units
and having the Transporters drop them to their doom.  But I'd actually ignore them for the time
being.  It'd probably be better to focus on the artillery base first.

	The artillery base is situated on a very tall mountain plateau, you can reach by ground
if you come from the north but it's better to use the Transporters to bomb them.  Now the base
has three Grizzlies with the heavy plasma cannon/plasma cannon combo.  There are two power
plants in the centre of the plateau that provide energy to the heavy towers and artillery.
Additionally in the northeast corner of the map is a small encampment that supplies ammunition
to the artillery.  It's only protected by a couple of heavy towers armed with chainguns but it's
best to ignore it for the time being.

	Use your transporters to pick the Grizzlies up and drop them on the 2 power plants.
A single dropped Grizzly will instantly the destroy a power plant and soon the area will be
helpless against your attacks.   Now build a base by the resource fields and you'll want to
produce some units to pick up the remaining shield projectors-I'd recommend a sizeable
number of them to pack electro-cannons while 1 or 2 should carry rocket launchers.  You'd
better mount some electro-cannons on your base because you'll soon be attacked by a platoon
of Jaguars with heavy plasma cannons.  If you have units that managed to pick up the shields
and a solid air force, the Jaguars shouldn't be too much of a threat.  Now go to the southwest.

	The base there isn't too heavily fortified and the defenders will probably be to scattered
to put up much of a fight.  Wipe out this base and go down to the tunnels.  There's 20000 credits
in the southwest section of the tunnels and throughout the tunnels are UCS units.  You'll have to
hunt each one down and destroy them all.

	With this finished, you'll have to destroy the small encampment to the northeast if you
haven't already done so.  Just send your forces there and they'll make quick work out of the
UCS base without breaking a sweat.  This will conclude the mission and Fang will stay behind
for the next step in his operation.  Since you can't take anything with you, build a recycler and
scrap every unit except for Fang and sell off all of your buildings.  End the mission and you'll
be able to do the mission New Hope.

			MISSION 7

			UNDER FIRE OR THE 2ND Ring

7) The 2nd Ring
Base Given: None
Units Given: 2 Craters m3 with heavy electro-cannon upg.1, 2 Meteors m3 with chainguns upg.1,

	You are told that the UCS are occupying precious veins of platinum and are trying
to prevent you from completing Project Sunlight.  Not only must you take back these areas
and wipe out UCS presence here but you are also to provide 40000 credits

	The UCS have bases in a triangle formation south of you.  The closest base is located
in a basin that isn't accessible directly by ground.  You can reach it either by the tunnels or
airlifting your forces in.  There are bases to the southeast and southwest corners of the map,
both of these can be reached on the ground but the bridges that link the two bases have been
destroyed and so the only short cut is by the tunnels.  Otherwise you'll be taking a long way
around or airlift your troops across the gap.  All of these bases has a crater with lots of
untapped resource fields, you have to put down at least one mine and 2 Xyrex power plants
in each crater.  There's also a very large resource field near where you start so make sure to
mine it for a large supply of credits.

	To the great horror of the UCS, on this mission you can develop artillery as well as
the weather control center.  If Fang and his group were brought over from Deadly Toys, they
can easily bust through enemy forces.

			MISSION 8

			NEW HOPE OR THE 3RD RING

8) New Hope
Base Given: 3 Research Centers, 2 Solar Batteries, Solar Power Plant, 10 Solar Cells
Units Given: Fang, 6 New Hopes, 4 Super Fighters m2 with AA Rocket Launchers
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: None

*New Hope is researched for free

	Fang tells you that he has developed a special unit for the LC's usage.  Unfortunately
the UCS have launched an attack on this region and so you must escort him and the New Hopes
to a safe location.

	First thing to do is outfit Fang and the others with shield projectors located in the area.
Unfortunately one New Hope will not have a shield but that won't be too much of a concern.  Now
the base that you're trying to reach has 4 Super Fighters.  Send them northwards so that they can
guard Fang and company from enemy air attack.  One thing to keep in mind is that you have no
way to build anything in this mission.  Still this mission shouldn't pose a problem.

	Leave behind the unshielded New Hope and go east along the passageway where you'll
fight enemy ground units and Gargoyles.  The Super Fighters will tear through the Gargoyles
while your New Hopes will be able to devastate the ground units.  Continue doing so until you
reach the first tunnel entrance.

	This tunnel system is just a very small square with a secondary tunnel entrance which is
where we want to go.  Now from where you start, if you take the path directly east you'll end up
facing a horde of Cargo Salamanders while if you take the other path you might be able to bypass
them.  Frankly I'd just set up an ambush for the Cargo Salamanders and lure them into a trap.
If you fought and defeated the Cargo Salamanders, go up the other tunnel entrance.

	Now you should be able to make your way to the southern base.  First bring in your
Super Fighters for one final fight.  Continue forward until your New Hopes fight a few ground
units and a horde of Gargoyles come after you.  The Super Fighters will be able to deal with
them and now it's time for your New Hopes to go alone.

	Just click on the southern base and watch Fang and company go.  With their great speed
they'll be able to bypass the Dragons in the air and enemy ground units that try to chase after
them will be shot to bits.  Don't stick around to fight because the enemy ground units include
Panthers with heavy rockets, Jaguars with heavy plasma cannons and Dragons with heavy
rockets.  If any of your units take damage just keep moving until you find a safe spot.  A quick
rest and your company should be back in top form.  Continue your mad dash and you'll make
it all the way to the southern base.  Fang congratulates you and promises you the designs for
the New Hope.

			MISSION 9

			NEW HOPE OR THE 3RD RING

9) The 3rd Ring
Base Given: None
Units Given: 2 Thunderers m2 with Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.1, 2 Crushers m3 with
     Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.2, 2 Craters with Heavy Electro-Cannons upg.1
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: Thunderer, Thunderer m2, Air Heavy Rocket Launcher, Air Heavy Rocket
	    Launcher upg.1, Heavy Electro-Cannon, Heavy Electro-Cannon upg.1

You are ordered to destroy the UCS presence in this area.  With their bases
in rubble, place a mine and two Xyrex power plants in the craters nearby.

	There's really nothing new here other than that the UCS are very aggressive and
will attack your base fairly often.  There's a UCS base on the northwest corner of the map,
a base to the southwest and finally a base directly south of your starting position.  Make
sure to put up a number of Guardians to block off anything that might attack your base.
There's a resource field near your starting position, mine it and the credits will just keep
coming in.

	It shouldn't take you long to destroy the enemy bases as the only difference is that
there are more UCS towers than in previous missions.  One thing of note is that you'll have
maxed out your technology regarding an air force on this level.  With this level done it's on
to the 4th Ring

			MISSION 10

			DEADLY TOYS OR THE 4TH RING

10) Deadly Toys
Base Given: Landing Zone
Units Given: Fang, 2 Super Fighters m2 with AA Rocket Launchers, 2 Thunderers m2 with
	     Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.1, Crusher m3 with Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.2,
	     2 Crions
Money Given: None
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: None

	Fang alerts you that the UCS have brought their offensive plasma weapon system to
the moon.  These weapons of mass destruction will be a great threat to Project Sunlight unless
you destroy them, Fang was able to scrounge up some support but you should airlift some more
help.

	Actually this is a really easy mission, as you are given some really powerful support and
the enemy is for the most part unimpressive.  If you did some Ring missions first, you'll probably
have some powerful units to call up but really the only thing you need are the Fat Girls from the
beginning.  First thing is that there are three shield projectors and lots of ammo in the area,
give one to Fang and the others should go to the Crions.  The Crusher and the Thunderers
were all ready equipped with shields.  Finally keep in mind that if you bring some money over,
the only thing you can build are more landing zones.  If you did some or all of the Ring missions,
you can fly over any of units built from the research you did in those missions.

	Follow the path east and fight off any attackers in your way.  When you begin to enter
what looks like a large area of space, hold back from entering just yet.  This is the area with the
plasma control center and it is well protected by 2 artillery, some heavy towers with chainguns
and a couple of Cargo Salamanders with AA plasma guns for dealing with aircraft.  If you go in
blind, the artillery can make short work of you.  Fortunately they have no Condors to supply them
once they run out of ammo.  So use Fang to divert enemy artillery fire and your ground forces
can easily destroy the base.  As you continue you'll happen on another similar area and there'll
be an identical base, take it out as you did before and continue.

	When you reach a third area of space, you'll find the only thing it contains are enemy
units.  There's a lot but they should fall quickly to your powerful forces.  Keep going until you
reach a fourth area, you'll suddenly be attacked by Jaguars and Grizzlies plus others.  They
guard the final base and once you destroy it, this mission is ended and you can now bring
Fang back home for other missions.  Also this is the last time Fang is indispensable, from now
on it doesn't matter if he survives or not.

			MISSION 11

			DEADLY TOYS OR THE 4TH RING

11) The 4th Ring
Base Given: None
Units Given: 2 Thunderers m2 with Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.1, 2 Crushers m3 with
     Heavy Rocket Launchers upg.2, 2 Craters with Heavy Electro-Cannons upg.1
     2 Crions
Money Given: 10000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: Crusher, Crusher m2, Crusher m3

	You are told that the UCS have refused any offer of a ceasefire.  They're invading
but you're on the last stretches of completing Project Sunlight.  Again build a mine and two
Xyrex power plants in each crater and this time collect 60000 credits for the project.

	Things are going to be somewhat trickier as you start in the middle of the map and
you'll face constant attack from various directions.  First thing to do is to mine the nearby
resource field and make several Guardians to cover each direction.  With the Guardians built
and an army established, the UCS don't have the firepower to launch an effective attack against
your base.

	There are UCS bases located to the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast
corners of the map.  Destroy them as you did in the earlier Ring missions and put up the
mine and power plants in the craters.  Once you've done all this and collected the 60000
credits, the mission is finished.  Lastly I'd suggest splurging on producing a large, powerful
army for the next mission.

			MISSION 12

			PAYBACK TIME

	This is the final mission of the game and can only be reached by completing
the 4th Ring and Deadly Toys.  You have one last new bit of new technology to play with
for this mission.

12) Payback Time
Base Given: Landing Zone, 17 NESTs, 6 Guardians, Aerial Supply Center, 3 Main Bases,
	       7 Solar Batteries, 5 Xyrex Power Plants
Units Given: 5 Super Fighters m2 with AA Rocket Launchers, 6 Thunderers m2 with Heavy
	       Rocket Launchers upg.1, 9 Craters m3 with Heavy Electro-Cannon upg.1,
	       7 Crions
Money Given: 40000 credits
Payment: None
Bonus: None
Research: None

*Plasma Artillery is researched for free

	You are told that the UCS are mounting one final attack to destroy the Sunlight
Control Center.  Do whatever it takes to stop them from doing so.

	The LC have been kind enough to provide a big base and large numbers of powerful
units to begin with.  Furthermore, you can now build Crions though by this time you'll probably
have used up all your unit limit and will have to recycle unwanted units or wait for some
casualties before being able to build.  Unfortunately all the Guardians and NESTs are located
in an encampment east of your starting point.

	The UCS have set up their plasma control centers and will eventually rain plasma bolts
on you.  To prevent them from annihilating your base, you'll have to go and destroy them before
they can begin firing.  They are located north, south, east and west of the Sunlight control
centers.  Send the units you start off with to attack these areas, luckily with the exception of the
east side there should be little opposition to stand in your way of destroying the plasma control
centers.  You might as well sell off all the buildings in the eastern encampment-this will free up
some power and money for you and allow you to concentrate on defending your main site.
One thing to note is that the UCS will be laying down buildings to form small bases where their
plasma control centers are located.

	While this is happening, the UCS will begin an early powerful rush on your base.  So
make sure to have shields added to all the buildings in your main site.  Also plunk down multiple
Guardians to protect your mines and the control centers.  You'll also want to bring down Fang
and other troops via the Jupiter.  I'd also recommend bringing back all those surviving initial units
that you were given and have them recycled.  This will free up your population limit so that you
can build an armada of Crions with shields.  Pretty soon you'll have such a well-defended base
that you can just sit back and collect credits.

	There are UCS bases in each corner of the map as well as the buildings built up where
the plasma control centers used to be.  However considering that you'll have a huge and powerful
army plus more than enough credits to buy lots of artillery and weather control centers; it's not
going to be a challenge in wiping the UCS bases out.  So just go around at your own pace and
destroy everything around.  With the UCS menace stopped and Project Sunlight ready for action,
this concludes the LC missions.

			LC MISSIONS COMPLETE!!!!

5.0			HINTS AND TIPS

Some ideas that might be helpful for newcomers to the game

-Always have a supply depot close to your troops.  This lessens the chance that your bombers,
fighters and supply ships will have to cross dangerous areas to reload.

-In single player, you can pause and still issue commands

-Experience gives you about a 10% boost to a unit or building's HP and weapon damage per
level, about every two levels weapon range goes up by 1.  So a Level 10 Siberia with a chaingun
is no match against a Level 1 Grizzly with heavy plasma cannons.  However a Level 1 Grizzly
going on to Level 2 gains a large amount of increased power.

-Aircraft typically don't need shields, the only exception is you're facing the UCS who can pick
you off with AA plasma guns.  Otherwise no other energy weapon can reach the skies.

-If you maxed out your population limit, you can still get more units provided it's through capture

-In single player, so long as you keep the casualties low, you'll have more than enough credits
to research everything, build a strong army and make a fair amount of buildings.

-Very few weapons can be fired while moving, if you're ever in danger a quick retreat and can
usually get you to safety.

-Artillery and bombs do damage in a blast radius and typically cause far more damage in a
direct hit than what their damage rating says.  When faced with such attacks, try to keep
moving before the attack lands.

-Terrain is very important in this game.  Rough terrain can either slow down or completely
stop a unit's movement.  Use this to your advantage

-Try to remember that different types of units have different lists of commands available to
them.  For example combat aircraft CANNOT hold fire nor can they be set on escort.

-Use weapons effectively.  For example, an unshielded Grizzly can easily mop the floor with
a bunch of Lunars carrying rocket launchers.  But if the Lunars carried electro-cannons it's
another matter entirely.  Likewise a Lunar carrying a shield can take a lot of hits from a
Tiger carrying a plasma cannon but a Tiger with a grenade launcher can take it down quickly.

-Shields and repairers/regenerators can greatly increase your chances of survival.  Remember
in this game, the longer you live to collect experience the more powerful you become.

-Obstructing building debris and vegetation can be dealt with by gunfire.  Burntout vehicle
husks can be crushed by units or built over with new buildings.
