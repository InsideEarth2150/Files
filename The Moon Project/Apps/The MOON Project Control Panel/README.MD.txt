A program by the Inside Earth Operations development group, which:
- fixes erroneous entries
in the registry (responsible for "Game isn't properly installed"), - checks if you have the latest version of the game (auto-update).
- change the language version of the game
to English (subtitles only),

- reduces the cursor (additions to the cursor), In addition, it contains some additions to the graphics (check it yourself).
Of course, all changes depend on the player's decision.
