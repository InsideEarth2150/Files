INSTALLATION

Insert the "The Moon Project" CD into your CD-ROM drive. When the 
Autorun screen appears, click on the "Setup" button to start the 
installer program. If the Auto-run screen does not appear after 
you insert the CD, click on the Windows "Start" button, then 
choose "Run". Type in the following command at the Run prompt 
(replace the X with your CD-ROM drive letter): "x:\install.exe". 
Then push the "Enter" key to start installing the game. 

COPY PROTECTION

In order to play The Moon Project, the game CD must be in the
CD-ROM drive.

--------------------------------------------------------------
GAME PERFORMANCE

If you're playing a multiplayer or skirmish game on a minimum 
spec machine, you may experience some slowdown when there are 
a lot of units firing on the screen. We suggest you limit the 
maximum number of units to 20,000 CR.

In multiplayer games, always make sure the fastest machine is
the host for the game. In addition, game performance may be 
adversely affected if the host machine is running The Moon  
Project at a very high resolution. Adding AI players may also 
slow the game down since the host will have to do more processing. 
On the MS Gaming Zone, we recommend a host machine of at least a
PIII 600 with 128mb of memory for games with 5 or more players.


To improve performance, we suggest that you reduce the Visible 
Range in the Graphic Options. Go to "Options" and click the 
"Graphics" tab. Then move the "Visible Range" slider to the 
left. Do the same with the "Maximum Zoom Level" slider.  You can
also turn off graphical effects such as snow, rain, and atmospheric
fog. Another area is the Finally, turning off the music 
soundtrack will also improve performance.  

--------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING

Video Card Issues
The Moon Project should run well on almost any Direct3D (Windows 
95/98/ME only), OpenGL, or Glide compatible 3D accelerator card 
that supports Z-Buffering, Bilinear Filtering and Alpha-
Blending. Video Cards using Z-Sorting instead of Z-Buffering 
are not supported due to advanced Z-buffer based tricks used 
in the 3D engine.

Most video display problems can be corrected by installing the 
latest reference drivers for your particular video card. Please 
consult your video card documentation for details on how to 
get the latest drivers for your card. 
	
If you are using a custom cursor, especially with shadow, 
it may cause video corruption. We strongly recommend disabling 
custom cursors while playing The Moon Project.

If your system has two or more video cards and you use windowed 
mode, The Moon Project may appear on the wrong monitor. Whenever 
you change your video card or reinstall drivers, run the 
Setup.exe to adjust settings. 

We strongly recommend using standard resolutions with a 4:3 
aspect ratio (e.g., 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, or 1280x1024) 
in HighColor or TrueColor mode. Remember: the higher the 
resolution, the slower the game will be, especially if your 
card has only 4MB or 8MB of video ram.

Memory needed to run the game in a given resolution:

Resolution		|	Video Memory
-----------------------------------------------------------
  640 x 480 x 16	|	  4 MB
  800 x 600 x 16	|	  6 MB
 1024 x 760 x 16	|	  8 MB
1280 x 1024 x 16	|	 12 MB
  640 x 480 x 32	|	  8 MB
  800 x 600 x 32	|	 10 MB
 1024 x 760 x 32	|	 12 MB
1280 x 1024 x 32	|	 18 MB
-----------------------------------------------------------

Exceptions:
   Voodoo 1     only 640 x 480 x 16 mode
   Voodoo 2     only 640 x 480 x 16, 800 x 600 x 16 modes
   Voodoo Rush  only 640 x 480 x 16 mode
   
   NOTE: 3dfx Voodoo chipsets only work in 16 bit mode.

OpenGL drivers enumerate TrueColor modes only if the Windows 
desktop is also in TrueColor mode.

3dfx Video Cards

Voodoo 3000 cards
Some users may experience a drop to desktop when viewing the
ending cinematics.  To correct this select Direct 3D HAL instead
of Glide from the SETUP menu.

When playing The Moon Project with a video card using any 
3dfx chipset (Voodoo 1, Voodoo 2, or Voodoo 3), the Glide 
renderer option should be selected in the Setup program 
for best performance.

Some older cards, e.g., Voodoo Rush and Voodoo 1 cards, do 
not support per vertex fog which causes the game switch to 
fog mode from "environmental" to "black". In some situations,  
you may have to switch fog mode manually. Go to "Options" 
and click the "Graphics" tab and then check "Black".

If you had a Voodoo card in your system at any time and you 
did not uninstall it properly, the game may crash. To avoid 
this problem, go to the "Windows\System" directory and 
delete (or rename) "Glide3x.dll".

Diamond Fire GL Video Card
Due to performance issues with this older card, it is 
recommended that you run The Moon Project at it's lowest
graphics settings and be sure you have the latest drivers.

Alt-Tab and Task Switching
Task switching via Alt-Tab or Alt-Esc is not recommended when 
playing The Moon Project. Task switching can cause The Moon 
Project to lock up and require you to restart your computer.
	
Sound & Audio Problems
Most sound card problems can be corrected by installing the 
latest drivers for your particular card. Please consult your 
sound card documentation for details on how to get the 
latest drivers for your card. 

If your system does not play audio tracks or plays them 
incorrectly (e.g., too fast or too slow) you can try 
reinstalling Microsoft's Windows Media Player, which is 
responsible for audio track decompression.

--------------------------------------------------------------
MAP EDITOR

A map editor is included with The Moon Project. It is an 
unsupported feature of the game. Please do not call Technical 
Support regarding issues with the map editor. 

MODEM TO MODEM 

While the game does allow for direct connect games, it is an 
unsupported feature.  Please do not call Technical Support
regarding issues with modem to modem games.

GAMEPLAY ISSUES

Naming Saved Games
If you type in a name for a saved game that already exists,
the game will not prompt you to confirm the overwrite.

Camera Controls
The camera is controlled entirely with the mouse. Moving the 
mouse to the edges of the screen will scroll the playing field 
in that direction, i.e., moving the mouse to the left edge of 
the screen will scroll the playing field to the left.

To rotate the camera, hold down the right mouse button and move 
the mouse left or right. To change the angle of the camera, hold 
down the right mouse button and move the mouse up or down. 
To zoom in or out, hold down both mouse buttons and move the 
mouse up or down.  You can also use the wheel on a wheel mouse to
zoom in or out.

To center the screen on the currently selected unit, press the 
"0" key on the number pad or right-click the unit's thumbnail. To 
follow the currently selected unit, press the "F" key. To move 
the screen to the last event, press the "Spacebar".

Main Base 
In the single player campaigns, each side has a main base area. 
From here, you can move units and resources to the mission area 
via the transport as long as there is a Transport Base or 
Landing Zone in the mission area.

You choose a new mission by clicking on the world icon. Keep in 
mind that buildings, units, and resources in the main base area 
are carried over from mission to mission. Therefore, it's a good 
idea to transport all units and resources to the main base after 
finishing a mission.

Transferring Resources
In the single player campaigns, there are many pressing demands 
for resources. Fortunately, you have a lot of options to deal 
with those demands. Generally, you will start out with a certain 
amount of resources in the mission area. This amount should be 
enough for you to begin a base in the mission area.

You may also have resources left in your main base area. This is 
an important point to keep in mind, as the resources in your main 
base and the mission are not shared; they are two separate pools 
of resources. You can transfer resources between your main base 
and mission area with the Transport.

Auto Resource Transfer
At the end of a mission, your resources will automatically be
transferred from the mission area back to the main base.


Research Tree
Press "F2" to bring up the Research Screen. The entire research 
tree for a faction can be viewed by clicking the Research Tree 
button the top right corner of the Research screen. You can also 
toggle between the Research Tree and the Research screen by 
pressing "F2" again.

The Research Tree allows you to view all the technologies 
available to you within a mission. You can also queue 
multiple technologies and upgrades by left-clicking an item. 
Right-clicking will cancel research on a technology.

Unit Limits
Each mission has a limit on the amount of units that can be 
built. This limit is expressed by an amount of credits or 
resources. For example, a 10000 limit means you can build 
10000 credits worth of units. You can view the current limit 
by selecting a weapons production building.

LC and Solar Power
Unlike the other two sides, the LC does not have to place 
their buildings near a solar power plant. However, solar power 
plants cannot generate power by themselves; they need to be 
equipped with solar cells. You can build Solar cells can by 
selecting a solar power plant, clicking the Solar cell button, 
and then placing the solar cell near the plant. Remember, 
solar cells must be placed near a solar power plant and each 
plant can have a maximum of 10 solar cells.

Also, solar power plants will run out of energy at nighttime 
or during cloudy periods. To maintain power, you must build 
solar batteries. Solar batteries store energy during the day 
and deliver it at night or during cloudy periods.

An alternative power source for the LC is the Xyrex
Power Plant.  It's advantages are that it outputs a lot of
power and does not rely on solar energy. However, it is
quite costly and requires a large building area.

Artifacts or Special Units
In some missions, you will need find an artifact or special 
unit. Don't assume everything is on the surface.

Recycling Units
You now have the ability to recycle units. That is to scrap
them and get resources back. To do this you must first 
build a Recycler building. Then simply click on the unit
that you want to recycle and click on the Recycler building.
Depending on the condition of the unit, you will get up to
50% of its value back.

Queuing Building Construction
You can queue structure construction by holding down the Caps 
Lock key, and then select and place multiple buildings.

Canceling Building Construction
If you change your mind, you can cancel the construction of a 
building. If you're playing either the ED or UCS, just select 
the partially constructed building and click the 
"Autodestruct" button. This will explode the building 
before it's finished. Any unused resources will be returned. 
If you're playing the LC, click the "Build" tab in the 
Selection Panel and right-click the building you just placed. 
You only have a short window of time to do this; if the 
building has already started its way down, you won't be able 
to cancel its construction.

Selling Buildings
You can also sell buildings after they have been completed.
To do this click on the "Sell" button.  A timer will start
and you will have 4 seconds to change your mind.  When you
sell a building you can only get back up to 50% of it's value,
depending on it's condition.  Also, since LC buildings are
cargo lifted when sold, LC buildings captured by the UCS
and ED cannot be sold.

Edge of the Map
Because of the way the camera system is designed, units and 
structures cannot be placed within 16 hexes or squares of the 
map edges.
