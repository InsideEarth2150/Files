II. The Armies

   A. Eurasian Dynasty

      1. Concept

The Eurasian Dynasty is the least advanced of the three armies.  In fact, much
of their technology is actually based on modern technology: helicopters, large
cannons, and treaded tanks are the basis of the army.  The strength of the ED 
is exactly that: they can kick ass and take names in a straight fight.  A 
Pamir will take down a Tiger or Lunar any day.  The ED gets some really 
impressive nuke-based weapons late in the game, but fielding them is extremely
expensive.

      2. Units

Gruz - The Gruz is a constructor unit, which means that it builds all the 
   structures you'll need.  If you lose your only Gruz and don't have a VPC, 
   you're screwed.  It also does some other useful things, like dig trenches 
   and tunnels, build bridges, and act as a damage magnet if you're feeling 
   daring.  During the campaign, if you save every unit you possibly can 
   you'll pile up a bunch of these.
Taiga - Taigas form the support structure of the ED.  Though they can be 
   lightly armed, they're not really worth the trouble.  Instead, Taigas are 
   best used in their Repairer capacity.  Also, they are the only unit that 
   can move containers from Mines to Refineries and Transport Bases.
Boyar - These are supply helicopters.  Boyars must be assigned to Supply 
   Depots, and will then carry ammunition produced at the depot to units and 
   buildings that run out of ammunition.  Boyars have no armaments and little 
   armor.
Siberia - The Siberia is essentially the combat version of the Taiga.  It can 
   be armed with just about every non-cannon weapon and is the second combat 
   unit you'll be using in the campaign.
Pamir - Pamirs are the first combat unit and the mainstay of your military for
   a very long time.  They can take hits like lighter units can't and have a 
   tendency to survive.  Their weakness is that the standard 105mm Cannon 
   Pamir is unable to attack air targets.
Kruszchev - The medium tank for the ED with a heavy hardpoint.
Ural - A heavier tank, this time with two heavy weapon hardpoints.
Caspian - Caspians are a rather unique tank built at the WPC that can run on 
   either land or water.  It's not a substitute for a navy but it will ford 
   any body of water without a bridge.
Volga - After the moderate success of the Caspian, Volgas were adapted to 
   carry heavy mount weapons.  Just like the Caspian it can travel over land 
   or water with equal ease.
Minelayer - These are useful in specific areas.  Mines are invisible to all 
   enemy units (except Minelayers) and completely harmless to your own.  The
   downside is that after they run out of mines, they can't be reloaded.  Your
   Minelayers can also be used to detect enemy mines and destroy any that the 
   Minelayer is directly next to.  Obviously, mines can only affect enemy 
   ground units or air units that choose to land.
Irkutsk - The Irkutsk is the first aquatic unit you'll use.  As such, it's a 
   light ship with one hardpoint that should be used in packs, not singles.
Leviathan - The Leviathan is appropriately named as the ED battleship.  The 
   ESS 200 has two weapon hardpoints and the ESS 300 has three.  Unusually, 
   you can choose to build either 200s or 300s even after you have researched
   the upgrade - this allows you to build either large or pocket battleships 
   at your discretion.
Cossack - Cossacks are the lightest air unit of the ED.  They are fast but 
   poorly armed and armored.  Cossacks make excellent scouts but have an 
   unfortunate tendency to blow up.  They can outrun rockets in a straight 
   flight.
Grozny - The Grozny is almost exactly the same as the Cossack except: it has 
   25% armor instead of tinfoil; it can carry a Rocket Launcher as well as 
   20mm; and it gains more HP as it gains levels.  Hold off on creating a 
   permanent air force until you have researched these.
Han - The Han is the heavy bomber.  It's big, slow, tough, and extremely 
   powerful when loaded with nuclear bombs.  Defend against enemy interceptors
   with 20mm fighter escorts.
Thor - Thors are the lighter bomber unit.  They're just as powerful but not 
   quite as durable as the Han.  The Thor can also be equipped with a 
   Container Hook much like the Taiga's Carrier, allowing it to move mineral
   containers from distant Mines to Refineries without ground travel 
   restrictions.
Fake Units - These are cheap versions of the Pamir, Siberia, and Kruszchev.  
   They can't take a punch but they will swell your ranks and look impressive 
   on the battlefield.  Despite their mock weapons fake units can't shoot 
   anything.  All fake units become available immediately after you research
   the real thing.
Truck - You never get to field Trucks in any ED campaign mission but the other
   two campaigns both see them.  Trucks are civilian vehicles with weapons 
   attached, not particularly combatworthy.
Tank - You can never research the Tank, but you will come across six of them 
   during the Arctic 2 mission.  They are much more powerful than Pamirs and 
   will serve admirably as the mainstay of your ground forces until you get 
   more powerful chassis.  Tanks come equipped with 105mm Cannons.
Heavy Tank - Like the Truck and Tank, you can't research Heavy Tanks.  They 
   only appear in one mission.  It's just like the ED Tanks but with a Heavy
   Rocket Launcher instead of a 105mm or 120mm Cannon.
NEO - NEO is a specialized Caspian converted by the hacker Neo for his own 
   personal use.  Neo is less an ED soldier than he is a private contractor,
   and you'll only have access to him for a few missions.  NEO has no weapons
   and no armor but if you act according to the mission parameters he has the
   ability to hack into the enemy computer systems and convert their units to
   your control.  You can seize the spoils and use them just like any other 
   units.
Ukraine - This is the transport helicopter.  You'll be using this to ferry 
   units and credits from your temporary mission base to your main base and 
   back.  The Ukraine needs a Landing Zone built in the mission base in order 
   to arrive, but it can stay after the LZ is destroyed in an emergency.  It 
   will carry up to 10 of any unit and 5000 credits.  If the Ukraine is 
   destroyed, another will automatically be built and deployed to the main 
   base area after a short delay, but you will have lost anything that was in
   the old Ukraine.
Lenin - You have zero control over the Lenin during the campaign.  It shows up
   every once in a while to move credits between Transport Bases and the 
   Spaceport.  No data, but it's nice to know what it's called.

20mm Chaingun - A very basic weapon available to all the armies.  It's light, 
   has high ammo capacity, and can attack air as well as land targets.  On the
   other hand it's very weak compared to later weapons.  The 20mm only fires 
   in straight lines, which means that your units must have a direct line-of-
   sight on the enemy.  If you're using a mob assault only the front tanks 
   will be able to fire.
105mm Cannon - This is the basic weapon your default Pamirs will be equipped 
   with.  It's powerful against ground targets and buildings but useless 
   against flying foes.  The 105mm also fires only in straight lines.
120mm Cannon - Essentially it's an upgrade of the 105mm Cannon taking 
   advantage of a heavy weapon mount.  Note that it uses 120mm shells instead
   of 105mms, so you'll have to do more research for maximum damage.
Rocket Launcher - Basically an upgrade of the 20mm Chaingun.  It's heavier, 
   deals more damage, requires frequent reloads, and can be mounted on Pamirs.
   The Rocket Launcher is also available to all three armies.  Default rockets
   are dumb-fire, but upgrades create guided rockets can track targets with 
   greater accuracy.  Unlike 20mms and 105mms, Rocket Launchers can fire in 
   arcs over friendly units, hills, walls, etc.  Incidentally, the information
   in the table is correct, but I have no idea why there's no difference 
   between 2x and 4x.
Heavy Rocket Launcher - Just like the regular Rocket Launcher, only with less 
   ammo and more damage.  It can only be mounted on hardpoints capable of 
   supporting a heavy weapon mount, usually large tanks and defensive 
   structures.
Laser Cannon - Unlike other weapons, the Laser Cannon deals no damage.  It 
   heats the target until fuel and ammunition inside the target explode.  Very
   useful early on, it becomes less so after the invention of shields.  A 3x 
   Laser will kill many units in a single hit.  Lasers are useless against 
   buildings.  As an energy weapon, Lasers recharge their ammo over time 
   instead of being rearmed by the Supply Depot.
Heavy Laser Cannon - Like the standard Laser but much more powerful.  If your
   enemies are fielding shielded tanks bust out this thumper to put some holes
   in 'em.
Ion Cannon - Ion Cannons don't deal damage either, but will incapacitate units
   and buildings.  Disabled units and buildings have blue static around them 
   and can be captured by any Repairer unit.  Ion Cannons are blocked by 
   shields and recharge their own ammo.  Upgraded Ion Cannons recharge faster.
Heavy Ion Cannon - It's the Heavy Laser principle applied to Ion Cannons.  
   Very useful to compensate for enemy shields, especially the LC.
Bomb Bay - Fly directly over the target with your bombers and drop stuff on 
   their heads.  Powerful, but only holds a few bombs at a time before you 
   have to fly home to reload, and you have to pause directly over the target
   before the bomb falls, leaving you vulnerable.  Difficult to use against 
   mobile enemies.  Nuclear Bombs are more fun than a barrel of irradiated 
   monkeys.
Ballistic Rocket Launcher - Don't lump these in with standard Rocket Launchers
   and Heavy Rocket Launchers.  Ballistic rockets fire in parabolic arcs up 
   into the atmosphere over impressive range.  You don't have to worry about
   seeing the enemy as long as you know roughly where they are.  The 
   disadvantages are extremely low ammo, expense, build time, the rocket hang 
   time that limits your ability to hit moving targets, and the fact that 
   these mobile artillery are completely unable to defend themselves.  For all
   that, there's nothing more fun than wiping out your opponent's entire base 
   with three well-placed nuclear rockets.  Watch out for SDI Lasers that can
   shoot down rockets before they explode.
Banner - Banners can be very powerful when used correctly, but they are 
   difficult to manage.  Every Banner mounted on either a building or a unit 
   extends an aura around it that increases the experience level of all 
   weapons by two.  It does not grant the corresponding HP increase to units.
   Banners are not cumulative.
Noise Generator - The only useful function of the Screamer in the single-
   player campaign is its ability to reveal Shadowed UCS units.  It also
   prevents enemy units from being able to receive orders, but the isolated 
   tank will still fire on enemies around it.  Since the AI just shoots 
   whatever it sees first anyway the Noise Generator doesn't have much effect
   unless you're playing a human opponent.
Repairer - This fixes the damage inflicted on your units.  It can only be 
   loaded on a Taiga.  Repairers can also capture enemy units disabled by an 
   Ion Cannon or help friendly disabled units recover.  Upgraded Repairers can
   perform field upgrades on your units or repaint them to show up as a 
   different color on the minimap, an option I find less than useful.
Carrier - To move mineral containers from Mines to Refineries you must use 
   Taigas with Carriers equipped.  No other chassis can equip the Carrier.
Container Hook - The Container Hook works exactly like the Carrier except that
   it fits on a Thor helicopter, allowing you to airlift containers instead of
   moving them along the ground.
Shield Generator - Another technology available to all armies, shields prevent
   energy weapons from having any effect on the physical structure of units 
   and buildings.  Since energy weapons are fairly devastating, this is very 
   important later in the game.  After a shield is exhausted energy weapons 
   will affect the target normally.  Shields recharge on their own over time. 
   Shields take up a separate slot from weapons or equipment.  All buildings 
   can equip all sizes of shield.

Power Plant - Power Plants both produce and transmit power to structures near
   them.  Unlike the UCS and LC, you'll have to place one for each of your
   building clusters.  Fortunately, they're simple, relatively cheap, and 
   small.
Vehicle Production Center - This structure builds all the noncombat vehicles:
   Gruzs, Boyars, Transports, and Repairers.  There won't be much use for it, 
   but it is absolutely necessary for the support structure for your army.
   VPCs have two weapon hardpoints.
Weapons Production Center - The WPC builds every unit that has a weapon 
   attached, both land and air (water units are built at the Ship Yard).  
   You'll be visiting often.  WPCs have one weapon hardpoint.
Supply Depot - These structures provide ammo for all your units and armed 
   buildings using ballistic weapons.  To get the ammo to those in need, each 
   Supply Depot must have at least one Boyar assigned to it.  The Assembly 
   Point referred to on its status screen indicates where the Boyars will wait
   between orders.  Supply Depots can be set to serve one tank, a few tanks, 
   or many tanks with the Fast/Average/Slow button.  Early in the game keep it
   on Slow, but as tanks become more expensive and powerful late in the game 
   you may progress to using the faster settings.  Doing so requires a field 
   of depots and a flock of Boyars, though.  Air attack units such as the 
   Cossack must fly back to a Supply Depot to rearm themselves.  Supply Depots
   have one weapon hardpoint and as a free bonus resupply themselves with
   virtually no wait.
Ship Yard - The Ship Yard must be located on a body of water (duh) and builds 
   all the aquatic units.  Ship Yards have two weapons hardpoints.
Mine - A Mine must be built over every mineral field you plan to use.  It 
   will tap all the minerals under it and for one square in any direction.  
   Mines produce containers worth 250 each that must be transported to a 
   Refinery or Transport Base by a Taiga.  The Mine will also show how many
   credits are left to be mined.  Mines have one weapon hardpoint.
Refinery - A Refinery converts the containers of a Mine into immediate cash.  
   This will show up in the cash reserves without any input from you.  Credits
   can then be spent on buildings, units, upgrades, research, or be moved to
   the other base on the Ukraine and used.
Transport Base - Unlike Refineries, Transport Bases convert Mine containers 
   into credits to be sent to the Space Port in the main base with no input 
   from you.  This is the key building of the campaign, and many missions will
   require a certain amount of credits to be sent to the Space Port in this 
   fashion.  Credits will accumulate until 2000 are waiting, then a transport
   will automatically show up to take them to the Space Port.  You can also 
   click the Call Trn button to send whatever credits remain to the Space 
   Port.
Small Tower - Small Towers are light defensive structures.  They can be 
   mounted with most weapons and are independently powered so they won't shut
   down when the Power Plant is destroyed.  Small Towers have one weapon 
   hardpoint.
Large Tower - More powerful than Small Towers are Large Towers.  They can 
   mount any weapon, including heavy mount weapons.  Large Towers depend on 
   Power Plants and will not function without power.  Large Towers have one 
   weapon hardpoint.
Pillbox - Pillboxes are heavily armored gun emplacements.  They are exactly 
   like Large Towers except that they have more HP and stronger armor.  
   Pillboxes have one weapon hardpoint.
Wall - Walls are cheap ways to prevent ground units from moving through a 
   given square.  You can order a Gruz to build a line of walls instead of one
   square at a time.  Walls can be destroyed with enough firepower.
Bridge - On mission maps with rivers or valleys you wish to cross the Gruz can
   build a bridge.  Clicking the bridge icon brings up a display of all the 
   potential places where a bridge can end on the map.  Choose one foundation
   point and the another across the obstacle to be bridged.  Both narrow and 
   wide bridges cost 50 per square, but using wide bridge makes your Gruz 
   build two squares wide instead of one.
Tunnel - Tunnels can only be dug if the unit is already underground thanks to 
   a Tunnel Entrance (see below).  Tunnels are free to construct.  Narrow 
   tunnels are one square across and wide tunnels are two squares.  You cannot
   tunnel through bedrock.
Flat Terrain - This is the remedy for trenches (see below).  A Gruz can 
   flatten a trench's sides to make it passable, though it's quite likely 
   you'll get stuck somewhere in the process and another Gruz will have to  
   flatten around you before you can move.  Sometimes you can also use this to
   make normally rough terrain safe for building structures.
Trench - A Gruz can dig a trench in a line that will block ground units from 
   passing over the tall sides.  See Trenches under Concepts for more info.
Research Center - One Research Center is required to conduct research.  Up to 
   two more can be built for extra speed, usually in the main base.  Building
   more than three doesn't provide any extra benefit.
Headquarters - A Headquarters will automate research, unit design, structure
   weapons upgrades, or base defense.  Each Headquarters can only be used for
   one of these purposes at a time.
Radar - The UCS Shadow Generator makes their units invisible.  The ED radar 
   makes them visible again so you can hurt them a lot.   
Tunnel Entrance - Tunnel Entrances allow units to enter the underground.  The 
   ED version is fairly slow and tends to bottleneck your forces, so build 
   multiple TEs if you plan to move large forces underground.  TEs can be 
   built from either above or below ground, but they are vulnerable both above
   and below ground while under construction; don't count on coming up in the 
   middle of the enemy base by burrowing under.  TEs can also be used by enemy
   units.
Landing Zone - The LZ is essential to call the Ukraine from the main base.  If
   it is destroyed before the Ukraine arrives onscreen, the Ukraine will 
   return to the main base.  If the LZ is destroyed while the Ukraine is 
   waiting above it, the Ukraine will remain there until it is sent to the 
   other base but will not be able to return.  If more than one LZ is built, 
   one LZ must be designated as the Active one.
Space Port - The Space Port is the only structure that cannot be built.  It 
   automatically exists in the main base.  The Space Port receives credit 
   transfers from Transport Bases, lumps them into 10000 credit units, and 
   sends them to the spacedock where they are used to construct Project 
   EXODUS.

   B. United Civilized States

      1. Concept

The UCS occupies the middle ground on almost all fronts in this conflict.  The
   units are moderately fast, moderately powerful, and moderately priced.  As 
   such, while they tend to not excel in any one area, they can hold their own
   in most situations.  For this reason they're my favorite army, and the one 
   I'm most skilled with.

Mammoth - The UCS constructor unit, like the Gruz in every respect.  Builds 
   structures, digs trenches and tunnels, and builds bridges.  Tends to pile 
   up in your main base.
Harvester - Harvesters are the means the UCS uses to extract minerals.  Each 
   one pulls the minerals out of the ground and then carries them to either a 
   Refinery or Ore Transport Base for processing.  The advantage of this 
   system is that there need be no structure built over the field itself.  If
   you can tolerate a long wait time you can mine any field on the map from a
   single Refinery.  A Harvester carries 500 minerals at a time.  Harvester
   IIIs mine faster.
Harvester IV - These are exactly like normal Harvesters except that they can 
   fly, making it easier to mine remote mineral fields.  Harvester IIIs cannot
   be field upgraded to Harvester IVs because IVs are considered a different
   chassis.
Condor - Condors are supply transports and exactly like Boyars in all areas.
Tiger - Tigers are the basic combat unit of the UCS.  They are light and 
   maneuverable and carry many basic weapons including the Repairer.  They 
   cannot carry heavy mount weapons or shields.  Learn to love them because 
   you'll be using them a lot.  Many missions provide you with free Tigers.
Spider - Spiders are slightly less capable Tigers that have exactly one 
   advantage: they can mount Shield Generators.  Spiders are primarily meant
   to be a support chassis with Repairers, Banners, and Shadow Generators, but
   can also mount light weapons.  A few missions provide free Spiders.
Panther - Panthers are the medium tank for the UCS.  They can carry any heavy 
   mount weapon and a Shield Generator.
Jaguar - Jaguars are the heaviest tank in the UCS army.  Each one is a very 
   expensive investment, so guard them carefully and keep them supplied.  
   Jaguars can mount one standard weapon, one heavy weapon, and a Shield 
   Generator.  They are slightly less hardy than Panthers but make excellent 
   assault vehicles.
Minelayer - Just like the ED Minelayer, it can lay a set number of mines as 
   well as detect and destroy enemy mines within one square.  Basic Minelayers
   start with 10 mines, Minelayer IIs have 20.
Grizzly - Like the Tank you can never research or build Grizzlies, but you 
   will capture three of them during Kurshatov FZ.  Grizzlies enjoy an 
   absolutely unique resistance to Laser fire above and beyond even what 
   buildings can withstand.  As such they are excellent fodder for the front 
   when facing a stream of ED Lasers.  Your captured Grizzlies come armed with
   a Heavy Rocket Launcher and standard Rocket Launcher each.
Shark - The Shark is the basic naval unit for the UCS.  It only has one weapon
   hardpoint, but they're quick to build and maneuver.
Hydra - Hydras are the UCS heavy bombardment battleship.  It's big, slow, and
   expensive; treat it exactly like a Jaguar.  Hydra Is have one weapon 
   hardpoint, IIs have two hardpoints, and IIIs have three hardpoints.
Gargoyle - The lightest UCS air unit.  It can carry either a 20mm Chaingun or 
   a Rocket Launcher, and is best used to provide cover for ground units or to
   escort  heavier bombers.  Like the Cossack, they tend to explode if left 
   unattended, so watch them carefully to prevent the enemy from sneaking up.
   Also useful for scouting.  In a straight flight without altitude change a 
   Gargoyle can outrun a pursuing rocket from an enemy launcher.  I recommend
   only equipping Gargoyles with 20mm because of higher ammo capacity and Bats
   are better for rockets.
Bat - Bats are the middle UCS air unit and the first true bomber.  They have 
   great range with their Rocket Launchers and are excellent for taking out 
   antiair defenses so the Gargoyles can sweep in.  Unfortunately, Bats are 
   very slow and only moderately armored, and so can be quickly dispatched by 
   enemy air units.  They also run through rockets quickly, meaning that a 
   good bit of game time is spent flying them back and forth from the Supply 
   Depot.  Bats can also be armed with Bomb Bays, but I recommend reserving 
   these for Dragons.
Dragon - Dragons are a significantly better chassis than Bats but cannot equip
   any weapon except the Bomb Bay.  I'm not particularly fond of bombing 
   because you have to get directly over the target, meaning that either there
   are few antiair defenses below and you can use your existing air force or 
   there are few defenses at all and you can use your army to mop up.  Dragons
   are much too large an investment to sacrifice to AA weapons.
Albatross - This is the UCS version of the Ukraine, exactly the same in all 
   respects except that it doesn't make the annoying propeller sound as it 
   approaches.

20mm Chaingun - Exactly like the ED version in all respects.
Grenade Launcher - Very similar to the ED 105mm Cannon, the Grenade Launcher 
   is devastating against ground targets and helpless against air targets.
Heavy Grenade Launcher - Just like the Grenade Launcher, but more powerful and
   more exclusive.
Rocket Launcher - Exactly like the ED versions in all respects.  Note that 
   Small Rocket Launchers can be loaded on heavy hardpoints for more damage - 
   these are called "Rocket Launchers" on the table.  Upgraded Rockets get 
   better tracking ability.
Heavy Rocket Launcher - Exactly like...you get it.  Upgraded Heavy Rockets 
   also get better tracking.
Plasma Cannon - This is the UCS energy weapon.  It can deal huge amounts of 
   damage to unshielded opponents and can even chew through shields fairly 
   quickly.  The downside is that it can't target enemies in flight.  Like the
   Laser, Plasma Cannons recharge over time.
Bomb Bay - Bomb Bays can only be equipped on the Bat and Dragon bombers.  You
   have to fly right over the target, but damage is impressive.  Payload 
   isn't; you only get 5 shots at most before the long, slow flight home for a
   reload.
Banner - Yep, it's a pretty flag that makes people rally.  Weapons gain two 
   experience levels when they are within range of a Banner mounted on either
   a unit or building.
Repairer - Not really a weapon but important nonetheless.  Fixes your units 
   and structures, captures disabled units and structures, and mounts on 
   either a Tiger or Spider.  The Repairer II can repaint friendlies or 
   perform field upgrades on existing units to bring them up to cutting-edge 
   technology, but it costs credits to do so.
Shadow Generator - This unusual device creates a fog of war around it that 
   prevents the enemy from seeing your units as long as all lights are turned 
   off.  Shadowed units have a gray haze over them.  The tech tree works funny
   for this one: SGs I, II, and III can be mounted on Shadow Towers and have 
   the range listed above.  SGs II, III, and IV can be mounted on units, but 
   act like one level below their rating, i.e. SG III on a Spider is the same 
   as SG II on a Tower.  Hence, there's no way to put SG IV on a Tower; it's 
   only meant to act like SG III on a unit.   
Radar - You receive Radar after researching Shadow Generator I.  It doesn't do
   anything worthwhile in the single-player campaign because you never fight
   another UCS enemy, but if you were to do so it would make Shadowed enemies
   visible.
SDI Laser - The SDI Laser comes equipped on any SDI Defense Center you build. 
   It will shoot down nukes and only nukes that target a spot within its 
   radius.  Ammo regenerates like all energy weapons.
Shield Generator - Protects units and buildings from assault by energy 
   weapons.  The size of the unit limits the size of the generator that can be
   attached.  After the shield is exhausted energy weapons do damage as 
   normal.  It's possible to equip Shield Generators on flying units, but 
   doing so is ludicrous since they can only be hit by energy weapons if they 
   land.

Power Plant - Like the ED, the UCS relies on nuclear power plants that 
   transmit power for a range around them.  Unlike the ED, UCS power plants 
   are pretty expensive, larger, and harder to take down.  They also take 
   slightly longer to build.  UCS Power Plants are capable of upgrading 
   themselves with extra reactors built around the plant to increase its 
   output more than you'll probably need.
Energy Transmitter - Power Plants may be similar, but the ED has nothing on 
   the Energy Transmitter.  When a UCS player brings up the energy grid (F9)
   you can see both yellow lightning bolts (current power distribution) and 
   gray lightning bolts.  The gray are potential areas of expansion by means 
   of transmitters.  Their range is smaller than a full-blown plant, but you
   can build 15 Energy Transmitters for the price of one Power Plant.  Instead
   of building new Power Plants in every one of your bases and fortifications,
   you can simply extend the range of one or two plants with transmitters.  
   The downside is that transmitters are pretty easy to take out, but they are
   also easy to replace.
Vehicle Production Center - Just like the ED.  It builds all noncombat 
   vehicles.
Weapons Production Center - Just like the ED.  It builds all combat vehicles.
Ship Yard - Builds all aquatic units.  Must be built on the coast.
Aerial Supply Depot - Responsible for making ammunition for your combat units 
   and armed buildings.  At least one Condor must be assigned to carry ammo to
   units and structures.  Aerial units will resupply themselves by flying back
   to the supply depot on their own.  If a Supply Depot is armed, it rearms
   itself with no wait.
Refinery - Refineries take the ore from Harvesters and give you cash on the 
   barrelhead in whatever base you happen to be at.  Simple.
Ore Transport Base - Similar to the ED Transport Base, the OTB accepts 
   donations from Harvesters and sends them to the Spaceport in the main base 
   in 2000 credit chunks.  Remember to Call Trn at the end of every mission, 
   and make sure the transport shows up and is heading back to the main base 
   before you actually close up shop.
Small Tower - Small Towers are small defensive emplacements.  They power 
   themselves and will continue to fire after the plant goes down.  Small 
   Towers cannot mount heavy mount weapons and have one weapon hardpoint.
Large Tower - Large Towers are the Small Towers' big brothers.  They can take
   more punishment, but must be constantly supplied with power from the Power
   Plant.  Take that away and they fall strangely silent.  Large Towers can 
   mount heavy mount weapons and have one weapon hardpoint.
Fortress - This is the most impressive dedicated defensive structure in the 
   game.  It's big, but it carries two heavy weapons hardpoints and two 
   standard weapons hardpoints.  The downsides are that it is very expensive, 
   presents a large profile to enemy attackers, and the entire thing goes down
   if the Ion Cannons get through.  Very annoying, that.  Other than those 
   small glitches, it will stop enemy mobs cold.
Plasma Control Center - Reagan's Star Wars finally comes to gaming.  The PCC 
   must build at least one and up to four plasma cannons around itself to be
   useful, not unlike Power Plant extra reactors.  Each cannon must charge for
   a (long) period of time, then can be directed to fire at any point or 
   structure on the map.  Expect some hang time as the plasma bolt goes 
   through a parabolic arc somewhere in the ionosphere before it heads back 
   down on target.  Damages an area around the target spot.  The cannons 
   charge _extremely_ slowly - it will take 2-3 PCCs with full complements to 
   really be effective in knocking out bases.
SDI Defense - If it is built and powered it'll stop ED ballistic nukes from 
   hitting your base for a small radius around it.  In theory.  I haven't 
   tested it out yet and I'm not really anxious to.
Wall - Exactly like the ED, but substitute Mammoth for Gruz.
Bridge - Still the same.
Tunnel - Yep.
Flat Terrain - <checks watch>.
Trench - One more time.
Research Center - These make research possible.  Just like the ED, you can 
   build up to three Research Centers for maximum efficiency.  It doesn't make
   the research itself cheaper, only somewhat faster.  Don't build the extras 
   in the mission base, because you'll lose them at the end of the mission and
   never get them back.  Research costs are only deducted from credit reserves
   in the region the Research Centers happen to be in.
Headquarters - Like the ED version, HQs allow certain functions of the game to
   be automated so that you, the player, don't have to worry about them.  Each
   Headquarters can only do one of the following at a time: manage research, 
   design units, structure weapons upgrades, and base defense.
Shadow Tower - It's a structure with a Shadow Generator attached.  See the 
   Shadow Generator equipment for more details.
Teleport - An oddly pointless structure, the Teleport seems insanely useful at
   first glance.  It will move any unit that steps onto it to a Teleporter at
   the other end, then move them back.  All sorts of fantasies about flanking 
   the enemy emerge.  Unfortunately, the Teleporter quickly bottlenecks large 
   groups.  Also, it allows enemy units to use it just as easily as your units
   do, meaning that your forward base can suddenly become a highway into your
   power and supply infrastructure.  Furthermore, you have to get a Mammoth in
   to build another end before it's useful, and the fact that a Mammoth and a 
   fragile structure-in-progress have to be safe largely on their own means 
   that the forward location probably wasn't that great anyway.  Teleports 
   require power from a Power Plant.
Tunnel Entrance - Similar to the ED Tunnel Entrance, this moves units 
   underground and back.  Because it uses teleporter technology, though, it's 
   much faster and the bottleneck effect is lessened.  TEs are vulnerable both
   above and below ground during construction, limiting the number of places 
   you can bring your units up.  And, of course, enemy units have no trouble 
   using it if they can restrain themselves from blowing it up first.  TEs use
   self-generated power.
Landing Zone - Landing Zones provide a place for the Albatross to arrive.  For
   more information, see the ED LZ entry.  LZs require no power.
Space Port - Exactly like the ED version except it doesn't look as stupid.  It
   takes the credit shipments from mission Ore Transport Bases and lumps them 
   into 10000 credit groups for shipment to the spaceship construction.  Once 
   credits leave for the spaceship, they're gone permanently.

      1. Concept

The LC represents the bleeding edge of technology in this new world.  The 
tradeoff for this is that their units tend to be quite expensive and rather 
fragile.  Unlike the ED or UCS, you probably won't manage much carryover 
between missions with this army.  On the other hand, you might not need it.

Phobos - This is the LC support unit.  It can't mount weapons, but it can use
   Detectors, Regenerators, and Shield Rechargers.
Mercury - Just like the Boyar and Condor, the Mercury carries ammo from the 
   Supply Depot to whoever needs it.
Lunar - Lunars are the most basic LC combat unit.  They are VERY light and 
   tend to die quickly in pitched combat, one after another.  They can only 
   carry a few standard mount weapons.  On the other hand, they're pretty 
   cheap and often provided by missions.
Moon - Moons are the first LC unit you might actually want to go into combat 
   in.  They carry the same weapons Lunars do, but can take a hit or two in 
   a pitched fight.
Crater - Craters are the heavy tanks for the LC.  They carry heavy weapons and
   don't die easily.  You might also get to preserve them for several missions
   with carryover.
Crusher - These are the two-hardpoint tank for the LC.  It's not quite as 
   tough as the Crater but has more firepower.
Meteor - Meteors are the LC's light air unit.  They're fast and maneuverable, 
   but drop like flies if not carefully managed during attacks.
Thunderer - For heavy bombing runs substitute the hardy Thunderer for Meteors.
   I recommend using an Air Sonic Cannon and leaving the Rocket Launchers to 
   the Meteors.  The disadvantages are short range and inability to attack air
   units, meaning you'll have to escort them with Meteors to keep them from 
   being picked on.
Crion - This is your reward for fully researching weapons.  The Crion can only
   equip the Plasma Cannon, but it's a decent tank with high regeneration and 
   good maneuverability.  Even ammo regeneration is acceptable.  
Fang - You'll begin the campaign with the Fang, an alien tank with rapid 
   regeneration and a devastating energy weapon.  The Fang is studied in 
   several missions by LC scientists.  The Fang's energy bolts can disable 
   units and buildings assuming they survive more than a few shots (this would
   be useful if you had a Repairer to capture disabled units), but it must be 
   stationary to fire.  It will quickly amass maximum experience if you depend
   on it early in the game.  Don't let the Fang get killed because in the LC 
   campaign you are piloting it - if it's destroyed you die, too.  Due to bugs
   it's sometimes possible to end the mission without actually returning the 
   Fang to your main base; don't make this mistake, there are several missions
   that specifically require the Fang to work.
Jupiter - The Jupiter will transfer up to 10 units and 5000 credits between 
   the main base and the mission base.  Just like everybody else.

20mm Chaingun - Exactly like the UCS and ED versions in all respects.
Rocket Launcher - Ditto.
Heavy Rocket Launcher - Play it again, Sam.
Electro Cannon - The Electro Cannon is the LC energy weapon.  It is moderately
   strong, certainly better than a Rocket Launcher, but it lacks the punch and
   range of either the Laser or the Plasma Cannon.  It also can't fire at 
   airborne targets.  The Electro Cannon, like all energy weapons, is blocked 
   by shields and recharges itself over time.  It can disable targets after a
   few shots just like the Fang's weapon, but you can't capture these as the 
   LC lacks a Repairer.
Heavy Electro Cannon - Same as the standard Electro Cannon, but bigger and 
   badder.
Sonic Cannon - The Sonic Cannon generates an unfocused shockwave of energy 
   around the unit that damages everything it touches.  It has relatively 
   short range and you must literally plunge the unit into the enemy's ranks 
   for maximum effect, but they do make for very dramatic last stands.  Sonic 
   Cannons are energy weapons and therefore recharge and are blocked by 
   shields.
Heavy Sonic Cannon - Second verse, same as the first.
Plasma Cannon - This one's a little tricky because it doesn't show up on the
   research tree.  After you research both 2x Heavy Sonic Cannon and 2x Heavy
   Electro Cannon it should appear on the standard research screen.  The 
   Plasma Cannon can only be mounted on the Crion and takes a while to reload,
   but it's the LC's answer to ED nukes and UCS Offensive Plasma Cannons.  
   Don't confuse it with the UCS energy weapon of the same name.
SDI Defense
Banner - A snazzy flag with a big star on it that makes your units feel 
   patriotic and better able to kill things.  All of your weapons within range
   of a Banner gain two experience levels.
Detector - The Detector slightly increases a unit's sight range and also 
   renders UCS units under a Shadow Generator visible.
Shield Recharger - The UCS and ED have to sit around to recharge their shields
   after a fight.  The LC is apparently easily bored.  Just mix one Shield 
   Recharger with several damaged units and wait a shorter time than you would
   have to otherwise.
Regenerator - Similar to the Shield Recharger, only for actual damage.  All LC
   units and structures regenerate over time, but the Regenerator speeds the 
   process up a bit.
Shield Generator - Shield Generators protect your units and structures from 
   the ravages of Plasma Cannons and Lasers.  They are essential later in the 
   game.  LC shields are stronger than ED and UCS variants because of superior
   technology.

Main Base - This is the heart of any LC base. the Main Base builds all units, 
   combat and noncombat, plus it mounts four (count 'em!) weapons hardpoints.  
   If it gets blown up, you won't be able to mount a counteroffensive with new
   units, but you were probably dead anyway if this behemoth got killed.  
   Don't confuse this structure with the main base area, separated from the 
   mission base map.
Laser Wall - Laser Walls are much more expensive than ED and UCS vanilla 
   Walls.  Instead of putting up one wall at a time, plot a line and a number 
   of Laser Walls will be lowered from orbit at points along that line.  Laser
   Walls are connected by laser beams to adjacent Laser Walls and this beam 
   cannot be broken by ground units.  The enemy can still destroy the Wall 
   structure itself, though.  To activate or deactivate a given beam, click on
   one of the two Walls holding it and then the other.
Solar Power Plant - The LC is much smarter than the UCS and ED.  They realized
   that it's stupid to put your power source right next to the defenses, 
   because then the power will go down and the defenses will be crushed.  
   Instead, the LC can beam power to their units and structures anywhere on 
   the map as long as they still have either a powered battery or a producing 
   Solar Power Plant.  Solar Power Plants must have solar cells built around 
   them to be productive at a cost of 100 each.  During daylight hours (watch 
   the clock in the upper left corner), the cells will collect solar energy 
   and beam it to friendly structures.  Power not currently required by 
   structures is automatically sent to Solar Batteries.  Solar Power Plants 
   produce no power without solar cells or during the night.
Solar Battery - Solar Batteries are the logical solution to the problem of 
   using solar power at night.  Batteries charge during the day with excess 
   energy produced by Solar Power Plants up to 100% and discharge during the
   night to keep structures functioning until sunup.  At construction all 
   Solar Batteries begin with a 25% charge.  Without Solar Batteries the base 
   will completely shut down at night.
Mine - The LC is the most technologically advanced army, so it dispensed with 
   the measures used by both the ED and UCS for mineral collection.  Build a 
   Mine on top of the mineral field and it will slowly process all the 
   minerals within one square of the Mine.  Mines convert minerals directly 
   into credits for your use.
Ore Transport Refinery - The OTR works like the LC Mine except it transfers 
   the credits produced to the Space Port in 2000 credit chunks.  Hit Call Trn
   at the end of every mission to nickel-and-dime your way to victory.
Research Center - One Research Center makes research possible, two makes fast
   research possible, three makes the fastest research possible, and four 
   makes wasting credits possible.
Aerial Supply Center - Exactly like the UCS and ED versions.  Set Mercuries to
   transport the ammo to units and buildings.
Defender - Defenders are the lighter base defense for the LC.  They are 
   independently powered and will keep firing when all power has been lost.  
   However, they are a bit fragile.  Defenders have two standard weapons 
   hardpoints.
Guardian - Guardians are heavily armored base defense.  They are dependent on
   the power infrastructure to keep firing.  Guardians have two weapons 
   hardpoints.
Headquarters - See ED and UCS versions.
SDI Defense Center - Works just like the UCS version to stop ED nuclear 
   missiles from landing within its firing radius.
Weather Control Center - Can provide a number of useful weather effects 
   depending on map conditions.
Landing Zone - Acts exactly like the LZ for the ED and UCS for the Jupiter.
Space Port - Accepts ore shipments from Ore Transport Refineries, bundles them
   into 10000 credit shipments, then dispatches them to the spaceship 
   construction site.

III. Game Concepts and General Information

Before I say anything else, there are two main strategies to winning any 
   mission that involves destroying enemy bases, and there are a lot of 
   missions where killing enemy bases is either required or so extraordinarily
   helpful that it might as well be.  Those strategies are:

BLITZKRIEG: Before the mission, load the transporter with combat units, 
   preferably air units because they have no restrictions on movement.  Upon 
   arrival immediately start searching the map for the enemy base.  When you
   find it, restart the mission and send your air units directly there.  
   Destroy any buildings in progress and any combat units you can find.  If 
   you have the muscle, gut the base.  Follow up with ground units from the 
   transporter.  You see, the enemy has to build up forces the same way you 
   do.  If you can strike with carryover units before the AI can put up 
   defenses, you can take out the base quickly and with minimal injury.  Also,
   using this strategy can net you the mineral fields of the enemy at almost
   full capacity, either for the Transport Base or cash reserves.  Keep in 
   mind that your enemy often has starting equipment far surpassing your own.

ATTRITION: This strategy works best after you discover Repairers.  Instead of
   attacking, just sit back in your base.  Secure any resource fields you need
   and wait out the enemy.  It will constantly send units to harass you, which
   you can blow up to deprive it of its resources.  Eventually, the AI will 
   exhaust its mineral fields and start heading for yours.  You know this has 
   happened when Harvesters start showing up, or LC Refineries start dropping 
   from the sky, or Gruzs won't stop trying to build Mines over your fields.
   At this point, the enemy forces have peaked and will not be able to replace
   their lost units, whereas you can always run away and repair to fight 
   again.  Be advised that this strategy takes longer and doesn't have the 
   resource bonus, but it is generally safer.

The next section is basic information about the game that should have been 
   covered in the manual better than it actually was.

- Main Base: During the campaign there is never any need to build a VPC or WPC
   in the mission area.  Instead, build units in the main base and ferry them 
   in the transport.

- Experience: weapons gain experience by killing enemy units, indicated by the
   dark bar under the HP and ammunition bars for every armed unit and 
   structure.  More experienced units have better damage and HP.  Experienced 
   armed structures have higher damage but no additional HP.

- Event Jump: Your aides will often give verbal alerts when certain events 
   happen, like completed production of units or sightings of enemy units.  
   Hit <space> to immediately jump to the location of the last announced 
   event, then <space> again to cycle through other recent events.  Eventually
   the jump clock expires so you won't be able to do this for old events.

- Carryover: At the end of every mission, pull all the units you can and any 
   spare credits and bring them to the main base in the transport.  Units that
   carry over like this can be shipped out to the next mission, saving the 
   cost of reconstructing an army.  Carrying over units also maximizes  
   opportunities for accumulating experience.

- Pickups: In missions that have existing tunnel complexes, there are often 
   spinning icons underground for your units to find.  Dollar signs are worth 
   10000 CR cash.  Laptops give information and are sometimes mission 
   objectives.  Blue cones denote computer cores and are often mission 
   objectives.  Spiky boxes with blue static fields will give any unit 
   shields.  Crates resupply units with ammunition (very useful in underground
   combat) and respawn.  Wrenches give full repair and respawn.  Radios 
   sometimes appear aboveground and give information or objectives.  I still 
   don't know what red and black cages do.

- Cycling: In many missions, there is a certain minimum amount of credits that
   must be mined and sent to the Space Port.  The only way the game will 
   recognize this for the objective is if the credits are sent by a Transport 
   Facility automatically.  You can also subvert the objective by using the 
   transport unit. Use the Give 2000 Credits button on the Transport facility,
   then wait for the automatic transport to take them to the Space Port.  Cut
   over to the main base, wait for the automatic transport to deliver, then 
   use the Take 5000 Credits button.  Move those credits back to the mission 
   base with the transport unit.  Check the objective and you'll see that 
   you've gained 2000 toward your goal for the mission.  Keep this in mind if 
   your mineral field runs short because you overcashed it.  Remember that the 
   credits must be made up to the space program in the future or you'll still
   lose the game.

- Trenches: Gruzs and Mammoths can both dig trenches.  The steep walls on 
   either side of the trench cannot be crossed by any ground unit, but it is 
   possible for ground units to go down the middle of the trench.  They are 
   also no barrier to air units.  Trenches can be used to great effect as a 
   defensive measure if the ends are closed by the environment or other 
   trenches.  Be very careful when trenching in anything other than straight 
   lines on flat surfaces because it's quite easy for the digger to get stuck
   in the process and you'll need another one nearby to flatten terrain 
   underneath it before it can move again.  Unlike building walls, digging 
   trenches is free.

- Automining: If you can leave a Transport Base with a Transporter, Harvester,
   or an LC Transport Base directly over a mineral field at mission's end 
   without any enemies or armed enemy structures, the miners will 
   automatically send the credits to the Space Port.  The End Mission button 
   will give you a report on this possibility before you confirm the mission 
   end.  This doesn't work if you use a Refinery; you have to sit there and
   ferry them all to the main base manually.

- Command Queue: You can set up any unit with a series of orders to follow 
   without further input from you with the command queue in the lower right 
   corner of the screen.  Hit <r> to start recording, then issue all commands 
   in the order you want them executed, then <r> again to close the list.  To
   execute the queue hit <x>.  You can also use <capslock> to start the unit
   moving as soon as you start issuing commands instead of waiting for the <x>
   key.  This is very useful for setting up a base with a construction unit or
   setting units to complicated patrol routes.

Though the UCS and ED run parallel to each other, the LC uses a few things 
   that are absolutely unique to them and totally confusing to me when I first
   played.

- LC Construction: Unlike the UCS and ED, the LC does not have a constructor 
   unit.  Instead, click the Build tab on the control panel at the bottom of 
   the screen.  Structures will be assembled in orbit and slowly lowered into 
   the correct position.  If you want to cancel construction, go back through 
   the Build tab and right-click.  Just like the ED and UCS structures are 
   extra-vulnerable during construction, LC structures are extra-vulnerable as
   they are being lowered.  If any units (including air units) happen to be 
   underneath the structure as it is lowered they are crushed.

- LC Power: The LC electrical grid has unlimited range on the map, so there 
   are no building restrictions.  It is based not on nuclear fusion reactors 
   but solar power.  Solar Power Plants must build solar cells to generate
   power during the daytime and generate no power at night.  Solar Batteries 
   must be built to ensure a nighttime power supply.  Batteries charge up with
   the excess power generated during the day and discharge whatever power is 
   needed during the night.  They will continually lose power if Solar Power
   Plants are not providing enough to keep the base going.  Solar Cells start
   generating power about 6:40a, hit peak at 9a, then start dropping at 3:30p
   until zero power at 7:40p.

- LC Flight: All LC units have antigravity capability to one level or another.
   This means that even ground units can float above water, so the LC has no 
   need for aquatic units of any kind.

- LC Regeneration: All LC units and buildings regenerate lost HP and shields
   over time as long as they are stationary.  The Regenerator and Recharger 
   equipment make this faster, but even units without these will recover from 
   mortal wounds eventually.  Point is: always withdraw wounded units so they 
   can recover and fight again, vastly improving their effectiveness.

The rest of these are tactical points/opinions I hold about the game.

- Air Units: Air units are the key to the easiest way into any enemy base.  
   Most AI bases are built around the principle of land-based attack, with 
   mountain ranges and gullies providing barriers and defensive structures 
   covering only the land and sea approaches.  Use air units to attack from 
   unexpected avenues and take out the enemy power plants so ground units can 
   sweep in and finish the job.  Use long-range rockets to take out antiair 
   defenses.  I recommend using max of four 20mm fighters and two or four 
   bombers so you can easily select damaged units and withdraw them during 
   firefights.

- Water Units: I have never found a use for water units in the campaigns.  
   They require thousands of credits in research plus a Ship Yard to produce 
   but they can't actually storm the enemy base.  They can't be carried over 
   into the next mission with the transporter, so any resources invested in 
   building a fleet are lost forever at mission's end.  Furthermore, they 
   can't even be used on many maps.  Spend your credits on air units.

- Research: Only research technology you plan to use.  If you're never going 
   to use Spiders or Crions don't waste the credits and time researching them.
   Stick to technologies you like and know how to use.

- Shields: After you discover Shield Generators you will be able to build them
   on every single one of your structures through the Building Upgrade screen 
   (F3).  You probably don't need shields on every one of your buildings, so 
   upgrade carefully.  If you're facing the ED, remember that Lasers don't 
   damage buildings and Ion Cannons only disable them.  On the other hand, if 
   you're facing the LC or UCS, their energy weapons can be very dangerous to 
   structures so defenses and the power grid should all have some sort of 
   protection.

- Weapon Stacking: Some heavy weapons allow you to stack a standard weapon on 
   top of the larger one.  It might seem like a good idea to put an AA weapon
   on top of an STS one so that the tank won't be helpless against air 
   attacks.  I'd recommend against this because it's easier to coordinate 
   attacks if you have one quick key for the AA forces and another for the 
   dedicated siege tanks.  When the AA/STS tank attacks an air target it has
   substantially less firepower than a dedicated AA tank.

- Tunnels: The UCS and ED can build Tunnel Entrances to enter the subterranean
   depths.  While this could add an interesting dynamic, it usually doesn't.  
   Tunnels can be used to bypass enemy defenses and arrive in otherwise 
   inaccessible locations with ground units, but the upper location must be 
   secured before a tunnel exit can be constructed.  In addition, tunneling 
   takes a long time, even with two or three Mammoths/Gruzs working alongside.
   The exception to the "useless tunnel" rule is that some maps have valuable 
   pickups or even mission objectives underground.  In any case, if you do 
   explore underground, do so with a constructor unit so you can burrow to new
   rooms if necessary.  Lacking a constructor, LC units can't tunnel but are
   free to use enemy TEs if opportunity allows.

- OVermining: Many missions require you to mine a certain amount of credits 
   for the Spaceport and give you an End Mission after that number is reached.
   If you're not in immediate danger, don't end the mission until the mineral 
   field is completely empty, and remember to Call Trn before you leave.    

- Main Base Mining: At the beginning of the campaign the main base area has 
   access to a mine with about 70000 credits under it.  Once it's exhausted
   all spending cash must be provided by mission Refineries.

- Constructed Upgrades: Over time, you will be able to research upgrades to 
   weapons and chassis.  Old units will not upgrade themselves, but all new 
   units have the upgrades at no additional cost.  The UCS and ED Repairers 
   are capable of performing field upgrades, but other than that you are stuck
   with the old units until they die and you replace them.  Therefore, in any 
   mission where you can research a weapon or chassis that you are currently 
   using, don't build any until the research is complete.  You will get 
   stronger units for the same cost.  The exception is ammo upgrades which are 
   automatically applied to every unit regardless of when it was made.

- Luring: The AI reacts very predictably to invasions.  As soon as any of your
   units attacks a base structure, all the combat units in the area 
   immediately descend to remove the threat.  Therefore, if you attack with 
   one unit and quickly run away, you can lure the enemy into a trap.  Make 
   sure that your bait unit has a bolt hole through the trap mob and that your
   trap is strong enough to actually stop the defenders.  Once this is done, 
   use your experienced units' superior range to whittle down any Towers or 
   armed buildings for a slow but simple win.

- Gutting: Every time your units attack a base, each member of the mob chooses
   its own target and keeps shooting until it runs out of ammo, kills the 
   target, or dies.  These targets are chosen largely by the order that they 
   move into the unit's field of view.  Therefore, if you let your units pick 
   their targets, they will waste time on Harvesters and Transporters while 
   air units and turrets pick them off.  Instead, send your units to gut the 
   base and render it harmless first, then set them free to raze it.  First, 
   kill the combat units you lure into the open.  Second, take down defensive 
   towers directly in your path.  Alternately, kill the power sources for 
   larger Towers and kill Small Towers and Defenders with concentrated fire to
   minimize losses.  Then focus on the power infrastructure to stop any armed 
   buildings from firing; this also stops production.  Finally, kill units and
   structures related to mining: Transporter Taigas, Harvesters, Refineries, 
   etc.  This prevents the enemy from sucking up any more of the resources you
   can claim as victor.  After that, the base is helpless and can be destroyed
   as you wish.

OBJECTIVES: All the Goals provided throughout the mission.  These must be 
satisfied to complete the mission successfully.  Sometimes it is possible to
continue the campaign even though you lost a given mission.
TRANSPORT: Outlines what units should be loaded in the Ukraine/Albatross/
Jupiter before the mission begins so they can be dispatched with all speed.  
Set this up BEFORE you click on the globe to select a mission.  Any time I
write <Pamir>, <Tiger>, or <Moon> means that you may substitute the combat 
unit of your choice.
RESEARCH: All the researches available during this mission.  Some missions 
have research overlap with others because you can choose which mission to take
first.
ENEMIES: The enemy base locations and types of units.
MISSION: The mission walkthrough itself.

   A. Eurasian Dynasty

      1. Ural
OBJECTIVES: -Find deposits
   -Provide your base with 20000 CR
   -Construct Landing Base
   -Fly two Ore Transporters to battle zone
TRANSPORT: Transporter Taiga x2, Pamir x3
RESEARCH: TT 110 Pamir 
ENEMIES: LC base on west side of map, several LC patrols of 20mm Lunars.
MISSION: Congratulations, it's your very first Eurasian Dynasty mission.  
After the mission starts, you will be taken to the mission base, which for now
consists of three more Pamirs and a Gruz.  A few seconds in, your briefing 
will appear to give you an idea of what you need to do (change the tab at the 
top for more explicit instructions, and you can return to this screen later 
under Menu->Goals).
 Group the Pamirs and Gruz and head west.  Cross a bridge and follow the path
around the mountains to discover a mineral field.  Build a Mine that fits the 
field, a Transport Base facing it, a Power Plant near them, and a Landing Zone
a little bit away so you have room to move.  As soon as the LZ is completed, 
send the Ukraine there with either the Ukraine's To Mission button or the LZ's
Call Trn button.  When it shows up, set the Taigas to working the Mine and 
Transport Base.  Sit there long enough and you'll finish the mission.  Load 
all the mission units back into the Ukraine and click the globe.
 Also on this map are a number of LC patrols and an LC base.  If you explore 
south of the southern bridge and into the center of the map you'll see them.
This is bad because your superiors will order you to destroy the LC, which is
a lot of work and definitely not worth it.  Therefore, don't explore at all.  
Keep all your units in your own base and you won't have to deal with the extra
objective.  If you accidentally trigger the objective you can either reload 
the autosave or Menu->Restart the mission.  If you do decide to take down some
LC sissies, remember to build combat units in your main base and ferry them to
the mission instead of building a WPC in the mission base.

      2. Arctic
OBJECTIVES: -Track down enemy troops
   -Find the enemy base
   -Destroy the enemy base
TRANSPORT: Transporter Taiga x2, Pamir x6, Boyar x2
RESEARCH: TT 120 Pamir
   MI 106 Cossack
   2x 20mm Chaingun, Helicopter Chaingun
   20mm Bullet x3
ENEMIES: UCS base centered on north side of map, UCS patrol in southeast 
corner.  Lots of 20mm and Rocket Tigers and Towers.
MISSION: This mission will see your first actual combat.  Head east along the 
coast with the Gruz in the lead to act as a damage magnet.  You'll encounter a
handful of UCS Tigers that should be easily crushed with concentrated fire.  
Keep going east until you hit a small pond, then north to find a mineral 
field.  Set up your base: Power Plant, Mine, Refinery, Supply Depot, and LZ.  
Be very careful not to move north of the mineral field or the UCS units will 
spot you, and you don't want that yet.  
 Bring in the Taigas and Boyars and set them up, then group the Pamirs and go 
east, then south.  You should run across a number of UCS Tigers.  Crush them 
and search for a rotating artifact that looks like a radio.  Collecting this 
gives you access to a bonus mission.  
 If you still have a decent military, head up north to assault the base.  
Build reinforcements if you need them in the main base and bring them over, 
transferring extra credits from your Refinery if they're piling up.  When you 
are ready, follow the chasm up north to the rear of the UCS base.  You'll be 
facing Large Towers, which need electrical power to function.  Take out energy
transmitters to prevent them from firing.  As soon as you appear, the UCS will
muster all its Tigers and bring them back to attack you.  Kill them with 
concentrated fire and be willing to take some casualties.  After you are 
relatively safe, knock out the Power Plant.  Now all the Large Towers are 
helpless, but the Small Towers will still be able to fire so be careful.  
Sweep south and west, destroying all structures, until you get mission 
success.  Pull out all units, drain the mineral field, and siphon the credits 
to your main base with the Ukraine before you end the mission.

      3. Arctic 2
NOTE: This mission is only available if you captured the radio artifact in the
first Arctic mission.  I also recommend you do this one after Kamchatka so you
have Repairers already when you begin.
OBJECTIVES: -Get to the Russian Base
   -Search for useful information in the tunnel systems
   -Locate the central computer in the tunnel systems
   -Provide your base with 50000 CR
TRANSPORT: Repairer Taiga x2, Transporter Taiga x2, Boyar x2, Pamir x4 (x6 w/o
Repairers)
RESEARCH: ZT 100 Siberia, ZT 101 Siberia, ZT 102 Siberia
   2x 105mm Cannon
   105mm Bullet x3
   Repairer
ENEMIES: Three UCS bases in the northwest, northeast, and southeast corners of
the map.  Ground units will be Rocket and Grenade Tigers; expect Gargoyles 
from the southeast base.  Harvesters will also appear regularly.  Raids will 
be relatively constant.
MISSION: Move the Gruz and Pamirs west and north into the center of the walled
area.  Build a Tunnel Entrance somewhere out of the way and an LZ.  Set the 
Pamirs to clearing rubble so you have some space to breathe and get the 
Ukraine in as soon as you can.  Have the Gruz go underground to explore when 
the TE is up.  Send it north to the intersection, then west to find a laptop 
(objective #2).  Now go east, follow the turn, and tunnel through the small 
blockage to find the central computer and two $s.  The computer core lets you 
move the six Tanks that are sitting close to where you entered.  Click them 
all and Change Script to a Battle Unit so you can fight with them.  Send 
everyone back up top.
 The core also gave you control of the structures on the surface, but they are
all badly damaged and unpowered and won't last long without immediate repairs.
Put up two Power Plants to power all the existing structures, then complete 
the wall around the base with the Gruz.  Leave an opening between the 
Pillboxes on the west side.  Mass your attack units and send them west to the 
mineral field, then north to a smaller field.  You'll want to mine both of 
these dry, but the UCS will try sapping the northern one first.  After the 
wall is up build a Mine on each of the fields and power for both with a 
Transport Base between them.  Start the Taigas running on the north field 
first.  By now all your combat units should have been transferred to the 
mission area.  Keep a handful back at the central base including some antiair
20mms and send the rest to protect the north mineral field.  
 After the UCS runs through its own minerals they will start looking at yours.
Each base will send units to attack you and Harvesters to try to steal your 
minerals, but you should be able to fend them off as they will only attack 
through the gap in the western wall.  Gargoyles might appear too, so be ready
with your 20mms in one group for emergencies.  You can equip the Supply Depot 
and VPC with weapons if you like, but it's not necessary.  After a while the 
UCS units will stop coming because they have totally run out of cash.  
 It's up to you whether to take out the bases or not.  You'll suffer 
casualties unless you're very careful, but it is worth a hefty chunk of 
experience.  Remember to lead with your new heavily-armored Tanks and fire 
from maximum range when taking out armed buildings and Small Towers.  Other 
than that, you should be able to just wait until the minerals are depleted in 
both of your fields.  If you do take out the bases, you can end the mission as
soon as you hit the minimum for the objective and let the Taigas do the rest 
automatically.

   -Construct three Research Centers
   -Secure Laser Prototype

   Rocket Launcher
   105mm Bullet x3
   Repairer
ENEMIES: The LC will build a base over your old one in the southeast corner.
There will be some raids on your new base, especially if you do not defend the
mineral field.  Ground units will be Rocket and 20mm Moons and Lunars, with 
20mm Meteors as air support.
MISSION: The start of this mission seems very intimidating but it's not 
really risky.  Select all three Taigas and move them through the east wall, 
then send them to the western base directly.  Have the Gruz follow them 
closely.  If any of the units exit the base to the west they will be destroyed
by approaching LC forces.  You need the Gruz to survive and the Taigas to be 
cannon fodder for it.  You'll still encounter the LC as you cross the bridge; 
there's literally nothing you can do about it except hope.  The LC will 
eventually stop following you, but by that point the Taigas will be gone and 
the Gruz will be heavily damaged.  If you are extremely lucky or skilled you
can save one of the Taigas by letting the Gruz take more damage from trailing 
Moons, but it's not worth reloading over.  
 Once the Gruz arrives, immediately build the three Research Centers behind 
the other structures and an LZ in the middle of the open area (the one south 
of the mineral field, not the no-man's-land between the turret walls).  The 
enemy will send tanks to attack, so let the Large and Small Towers take them 
out.  Set up a Mine and Refinery on the mineral field.  When you get a chance,
build a wall north of the Mine and a Small Tower or two; otherwise the LC will
flank you with Meteors and tanks approaching from the beach later.  Get your 
research going on Repairers, the Siberia, and Cossacks.  Cossacks are flying 
Faberge eggs, but they are a necessary first step for your air force.
 By now your superiors will have informed you that you need to go back to the 
old base, now overrun with the LC, and explore underground to find a Laser 
unit.  Build up to the unit limit (set for each mission and visible on the WPC
status screen).  The LC is using Meteors, so build some antiair 20mm Siberias 
or Cossacks.  Remember: don't build Siberias until you have completely 
researched them in order to get the most for your production credits.
 When you are ready, assemble your mob and head back the way you came.  Have 
the Gruz (repaired by now, right?  Right?) follow so you don't have to waste 
time later waiting for it to trundle to the site.  You'll run into a few units
on the way but should take them out in short order.  Make sure your antiair 
are grouped together for quick selection and countermeasures because your 
Pamirs are helpless against Meteors.  Approach the base from the west to 
prevent your Boyars from taking damage while reloading your units.  Some LC 
tanks may run into the wilderness when they take damage; follow them and kill 
them. If left alone too long, they can regenerate and become a threat.  
 As soon as your tanks have cleared the northern part of the LC base, let the 
Gruz build a TE in a safe spot within the walls and go down.  The Laser 
Siberia should show up on the map on its own.  Change Script and get it back 
to the western base.  Drain the mineral field, evacuate your units, transfer 
the credits, and end the mission.

      5. Leviathan
OBJECTIVES: -Destroy robots with new Laser weapon
   -Locate LC base and destroy it
TRANSPORT: Boyar x2, Repairer x1, 20mm Siberia x3, Laser Siberia x1, Pamir x3
RESEARCH: Laser (after test), 2x Laser, 3x Laser 
ENEMIES: The LC base is at the east edge of the map.  It is defended by 
Electro Moons.  There will be one attack shortly after the test is completed.
MISSION: At first you can only control the Laser Siberia.  Send it north and 
west to the small enclosed area with six disabled robots.  Kill them.  
 You will get a message that the LC has arrived in the area, gain control of 
all the structures and units, and be able to research Lasers.  The LC will 
attack immediately, so be ready with the Laser Siberia and Pamirs and call in 
reinforcements with a shiny LZ.  Get all your carryover units together and 
loaded and move east to the LC base.  Kill everything.  Build a Mine and send 
a Transporter Taiga to the LC mineral field if you really want to maximize 
your profits, then let it run automatically after you leave.

      6. Canada
OBJECTIVES: -Find main computer and copy project data
   -Destroy enemy base
TRANSPORT: Grozny x4 (or Cossacks), Transporter Taiga x4, Repairer Taiga x2
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: Three enemy bases, all of which are revealed to you when the mission
begins.  Surface enemies are generally 20mm Gargoyles and Plasma Tigers.  
Underground you will face Panthers armed with Plasma Cannons.  Lots of them.
MISSION: Set up your base to the southwest near the mineral field.  You'll 
want two Mines here so you can pull the minerals out and send them home.  This
mission is an opportunity to really set aside a chunk of change for EXODUS.
 The enemy is massing forces for raids at three points on the map: south of 
your base, west-southwest, and east-southeast.  Use your air force to knock 
them out, then send them to the west base.  If you're fast enough the UCS 
won't have defenses over their mineral field yet. You can hover just to the
west and kill all the Harvesters, starving him.  There are scattered Sharks 
east of this base, northwest of the east base, and at the center of the map 
that you can also mop up.  For now, that's all you need to do above ground.
 The next part is tricky.  Your initial objective is only to find the enemy 
computer core, and you are told that you can use the underground tunnels to 
get to it.  This is true.  The core is under the southern enemy base.  The 
downside is that the underground of this map is infested with patrols of 
Plasma Spiders and Panthers, and you don't have shields yet.  The only weapon 
with enough punch to take down Panthers quickly is the Triple Laser, so build 
at least six of them if you plan to play by the mission's rules.  Also bring 
down a Repairer and get ready for a long crawl.  Have fun.
 Still here?  Good.  No one says you have to play by the rules at all.  Build 
a TE east of the field and send a Gruz down.  You'll see tunnels to the north,
but don't burrow into them.  Instead, start a long mission and burrow straight
south.  Then cut east into the tunnel system below the southern enemy base.  
If you stray from your path into the surrounding tunnels, your Gruz will be 
killed.  It might be killed anyway so save often.  Also, autodestruct the TE 
to make sure that roaming Panthers won't come up into your base and wreak 
havok.  You should be able to find the core and a laptop that reveals the 
entire underground map.  You can spend a little time hunting down the few 
pickups underground, but there is nothing worthwhile.  Write this Gruz off 
because it's not worth the recovery effort.
 Now that you have the computer data, you are commanded to destroy the enemy 
bases.  The first one is starved and no longer a threat - use your air force
to kill the power and let the army clean up.  The east base has a large force 
of Gargoyles, so lure them out of the defense grid by hovering over the 
coastal plain to the west.  Knock them down to size, then gut the power and 
let the tanks mop up again.  
 Now that the first base has been cleared you can build another Mine over its
old field.  There is another field at the southern tip of the west peninsula 
you can also exploit.  Allocate Refineries and Transport Bases as you see fit.
 The southern base is a bit harder, mostly because you have to take it down 
entirely with air and naval forces.  It is also holding a large naval force 
just to the north and a flock of Gargoyles.  By now the mineral field east of
this base is probably empty, so the Harvesters will provide easy targets.  
Attacking them will draw out the Gargoyles and a few Rocket Tigers - proceed
with caution and repair when necessary.  After the defenders are down take 
out the Research Center.
 There is one more mineral field just west of the center of the map that you 
can exploit, but you will have to build a bridge to reach it.  Also, you 
cannot end the mission and automine unless you clear out all the Panthers and 
Spiders underground first - that's just not worth it at all.  Wait out your 
mining ops and pull the Transporters back before you leave.

      7. Alaska
OBJECTIVES: -Destroy enemy base
   -Supply base with 100000 CR
TRANSPORT: Tank x6, <Pamir> x4
RESEARCH: MI 140 Grozny
   2x Rocket Launcher, 3x Rocket Launcher
   Helicopter Rocket Launcher, 2x Helicopter Rocket Launcher
   Medium Defense Building
ENEMIES: There are three UCS bases on this map. The first is over the large 
mineral field, the second is in the southern central part of the map, and the
third spans from the northern central area to the northwest corner.  You'll
see lots of Rocket and Grenade Tigers plus 20mm Gargoyles, but the main threat
is the Rocket Small Towers lining two long corridors.
MISSION: Get comfortable, because no matter what this will be a long mission.
You get started with two Cossacks, a Gruz, and an LZ near a small mineral 
field with a recon report on a large mineral field to the north.  Call the 
Ukraine and get the Gruz started on building a Mine and Refinery on the small 
field.  Don't build anything else here because this won't be your base.  
 When the transport arrives send all the tanks in to destroy the UCS base over
the large field.  There will only be one or two Rocket Tigers and some 
structures equipped with Rockets.  Take it out quickly because if you wait to 
assemble your entire army the base will be much better defended.  Keep the 
Ukraine pulling in your units, combat first, then support.  You'll need at 
least 6 Transporter Taigas to finish the mission as quickly as possible.  
 After the field is secured send the Gruz north and build three Mines over it
with as little overlap as possible.  Two Transport Bases should be all you 
need.  Also put up two Supply Depots, at least two Power Plants, and a second 
LZ (I find that the first one always gets destroyed by a Gargoyle I didn't 
see coming).  I also built a wall around most of my base, but I think this was
a waste of resources.  Empty the small field first into your Refinery for 
cash, then get the extra pair of Taigas onto the large field.  
 Once you are set up enemy units will start trickling in for the entire 
mission.  Be ready for attacks from both the southwest and northwest passages.
Don't try to follow these back for a counterstrike because both passages are 
lined with Rocket Towers that will whittle down your forces.  It's also not 
worth scouting with the Cossacks because this will entice entire flocks of 
Gargoyles to descend on your base.  Set up the small field Mine with a 20mm 
but don't bother equipping the others.  Let the ground units do the fighting 
and repair them frequently to keep them alive.  There's a lot of experience to
be had on this map if you play it right.  
 Once the small field is drained, abandon that base entirely and pull your 
units back closer to the Mines.  Wait out the mission.  If you want to, you 
can tap the large field with another Refinery, but it can be risky because 
there are a limited number of minerals under the field.  Specifically, it's 
worth about 166K, and 100K of that must go to the Transport Base or you'll
never be able to finish the mission.  Drain the field completely and Call Trn
before you evacuate.

   -Destroy enemy base in the West
   -Destroy enemy base in the Southeast
TRANSPORT: All available Cossacks and Groznys, then Tanks.
RESEARCH: TK 100 Caspian, TK 101 Caspian, TK 111 Caspian
   ESS 30 Irkutsk, ESS 40 Irkutsk
ENEMIES: From the mission goals, you know there are three LC bases on this 
map and their approximate locations.  What they don't tell you is that the 
West base will attack with mostly Electro Moons and some Rocket Meteors 
and the Southeast base will use mostly Rocket Meteors with some Electro Moons.
I'm not sure what the South base uses because I kill it quickly, but I think 
it leans toward Electro tanks.  The Electro Cannons the LC uses run through 
your Pamirs pretty quickly and will continue doing so until you discover 
Shield Generators.
MISSION: The first part of this mission is heavily reliant on speed.  Unload 
the Ukraine, group whatever units you have, and send them south along the 
corridor to the largest base as soon as they have disembarked.  Use the air
force to provide cover for your Tanks and Pamirs, especially against Meteors.
Take out the base power before you get too close to the Guardians and you 
should be okay.  It is very important to handle this quickly because if you 
allow this base to grow it will become much more difficult to take down.
 Killing this base also gives you access to its rich mineral field, but you 
don't have the units to defend this satellite mine as well as your original 
base.  Keep pumping carryover units into the mission with the Ukraine and 
build Groznys up to the limit.  
 The other two bases won't be nearly so easy.  The West base is protected by 
mountains and a beach, and the Southeast base is waterlocked.  This means you
must use either water or air forces to take them out.  The designers 
thoughtfully provided you with a Ship Yard that will be destroyed unless you 
dedicate many units to protecting it.  In any case, my aversion to water units
still applies: even if you research them, they won't be able to completely 
take out the bases and you will have to resort to air units anyway.  Thus, 
this is the mission where you grow proficient with your air force.
 Take down the west base first, if only because it's closer to your repair and
supply facilities.  Whittle down the enemy's power structures from the 
mountain range between your bases.  Your air force should consist of at least 
four units: the two Cossacks from Alaska and at least two Groznys.  Using 
20mms or Rocket Launchers depends on your style.  After the power is down, 
kill the rest of the base.  If you haven't already, now is the time to take 
advantage of the abandoned mineral field to the south.  You'll probably have 
to scrape LC Refineries off it.  Set it up with a Transport Base.
 Repeat this strategy for the Southeast base, only with more care.  There's 
usually a large empty area of land just north of the base where you can 
assemble your air force before attacking, but move a Repairer to the southern
coast as close as you can get it so the choppers don't have to fly all the way
back to the base to get fixed up.  The enemy will foolishly devote resources 
to land units that you can take down from the sky, then move and kill off 
Mines and solar cells to starve them.  Even though the mineral field was 
probably close to empty, this will help you finish them off.  Take it slow and
preserve your now-experienced air force.  When they're all dead, check the 
south field and make sure it will automine after you leave.

      9. Great Lakes
NOTE: I recommend doing New York before the Great Lakes because you can put 
the Gargoyles liberated there to work here.  An air force is very necessary 
for this mission or else the Plasma Cannons will shred you.
OBJECTIVES: -Destroy enemy Research Complex
   -Search alien base
TRANSPORT: Grozny x4, Transporter Taiga x2, Gargoyle x4
RESEARCH: MI 150 Grozny
ENEMIES: There are two bases on this map: one in the northeast corner revealed
to you at the beginning of the mission and another in the middle of the 
southern edge of the map.  The enemy will field many Plasma Tigers and Spiders
as well as 20mm Gargoyles.  Every building will be armed with either a Rocket 
Launcher or Plasma Cannon.  And you STILL don't have shields.
MISSION: Your objective for this mission is to destroy the three Research 
Centers spotlighted at the beginning of the mission.  To do this, you'll have 
to take out all of the enemy units and most of the base just to get close 
enough.  Then the second stage kicks in and you have to get a Gruz into this 
base, but we'll talk about that later.
 Send your new Pamirs and Gruz south to the mineral field.  Along the way 
you'll pass four 20mm Small Towers, but you can run them safely with minimal 
damage and your tanks might even take one out on their own.  Call in your air
force ASAP at the LZ.  Have the Gruz set up the usual: two Mines, a Transport 
Base, two Supply Depots, two Power Plants, and another LZ closer to your base 
of operations.  
 As soon as your air force starts arriving, send them south and east along the
coast to a bridge.  Dodge around the Fortress here and cut off its Power 
Plant and defending Small Towers, then start killing off the Plasma Spiders 
assembled here.  If you wait on this they'll kill your LZ and migrate to your
base, becoming a much larger problem in the long run.  
 After this is done, ignore the Fortress (it's helpless and won't be fixed) 
and fly due north to the edge of the map, then east.  Try to knock down a few 
Harvesters and defending Gargoyles before you head back to base for repairs.  
Don't let your units fly over the base to return.  Just keep chipping away at 
this base for the rest of the mission - the Power Plants are located on the 
northern border and next to the Refineries.  This base will continually build 
Gargoyles to oppose you, so keep swatting them down as you crawl through.
 You won't have to worry about the second base to the south much until after 
you've incapacitated the northeast one.  As you're taking it apart, a large 
flight of Gargoyles may attack from the west.  If you're not expecting this it
can be very painful.  Counter it by either taking this base out early
(difficult, and not really a priority) or by sweeping down after you render 
the first base harmless to kill off the Gargoyles and Harvesters.  There are 
two muster points that this base uses to collect Gargoyles and Plasma Tigers -
one west of your base on a plain and the other to the southeast, both of which
you should clear out before you head for the base itself.
 After the Research Centers go down, you get a new objective to investigate an
underground alien base.  You can do this one of two ways: 1) send a Gruz into 
the northeast base after it is defenseless and down the UCS TE, or 2) build a 
TE in your own base and tunnel north to the bedrock, then west around it and 
northeast to the objective.  The second one is totally safe and can be 
initiated before the base goes down but takes a LONG time.  If you send your 
Gruz down the enemy TE, go to the southern chamber and tunnel west to bypass 
the bedrock and reach the base.  The only thing here is a black cone (alien 
computer core?), so snag it and head for home.  Make sure you also pump out 
whatever minerals are left in the two enemy bases and the extra field west of 
the southern base.

TRANSPORT: empty
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: Rocket and 20mm Towers throughout the map, Grenade and Rocket Tigers,
and several 20mm Gargoyles (more on these later).
MISSION: This mission is totally different from anything you've faced before. 
You have exactly one unit, a Caspian that has been modified to be completely 
defenseless.  If you get attacked at any point in the mission, you have two
options: 1) run away or 2) die.  Woohoo.
 However, you can use the tunnel systems to get around to your objectives.  
There are no UCS combat units in the tunnels, though Harvesters do use them to
get from mineral fields to Refineries.  Therefore, you are safe below until 
you start leading Tigers down after you.  Also, the enemy has no naval units 
at all, but the air force will follow you over the water and won't be fooled 
by the go-down-one-hole-and-come-up-another trick.  
 You can survive this mission without Neo taking any damage at all.
 Your first target is in the middle of the map.  Go west-southwest along the 
water, staying clear of the coasts and the Towers on them.  There are two 
beaches protected by WWII-era landing blocks, but they won't stop one small 
unit.  Go to the west beach and south to the UCS TE.  Underground, go 
northwest through a triple corridor and you'll reach the first computer core.
 Before you go back above, travel back east along the north edge of the system
until you find a small blind U-turn to the north.  At the end of this passage 
is a laptop that will show you the entire tunnel system on this map.  Go back 
up the same TE you came down.
 Retrace your path back to the LZ, then go south to the corner of the map.  
Keep your distance from the Towers.  Swing west and you'll find another TE 
near a mineral field.  Use it and find the computer core near the mainframe 
panel to the northeast and return.
 Back up top, follow the west edge of the map north to a bridge, then use the 
TE overlooking the sea.  Go north and use another TE, then dodge northwest 
quickly to the last TE.  You will probably be leading a few Grenade and Rocket
Tigers from the main UCS base in the north, so move quickly.  There is a 
laptop in a southern branch of the tunnel soon after you enter in a room with 
three green columns, but I have no idea what it does. If you didn't grab the 
other laptop in the first tunnel, this one will still do absolutely nothing.  
Just before you grab the last core, save your game and slow it down as much as
possible. The reason is that as soon as you snag it and fulfill your 
objectives, all the mobile enemy units on the map will become yours.  Quickly 
look over the main UCS base on the north edge of the map and send any freshly 
converted Gargoyles to your LZ.  If you wait, they will be destroyed by all 
the Rocket Launchers attached to buildings in this area.  This is an excellent
opportunity to flesh out your air force at no cost to you.  
You also have an important choice here: if you completed this mission quickly 
(as in under 10 minutes) you will only gain about four Gargoyles.  If you 
choose to wait around in a safe place for another hour, you can liberate ten 
or more.  Remember that time is precious.  
The rest of the new units will probably be destroyed by Towers.  There is 
absolutely no point to rescuing Harvesters because you can't use them, but you
can salvage a Mammoth and a few Tigers if you are willing to build bridges to 
the LZ for them.  It's not really worth the time.  Rescue Neo and your new 
Gargoyles and go home.

ENEMIES: Some Pamir patrols
MISSION: The first mission is easy.  It's not even necessary to actually 
engage in combat.  As soon as you enter, send the Mammoth north and build a 
Refinery and Power Plant next to the mineral field.  After those go up and the
Harvesters start rolling, send a Mammoth up north to where the mountains are 
closest and dig a trench across the gap.  The idea here is to prevent enemy 
units from being able to roll close enough to your base to fire on your units.
If the Mammoth gets stuck, use the other one to flatten the terrain around it 
until it can get moving.  Once the north trench is completed, do the same for 
the south end of the valley.  After these two trenches are complete, your base
is completely safe from the enemy and you won't have to deal with them.  Empty
the mineral field and pull out all the units.  Set the Harvesters to mining 
the field in your main base.

      2. Arctic
OBJECTIVES: -Defend base for two days (time remaining)
TRANSPORT: empty
RESEARCH: Tiger III
   2x 20mm Chaingun
   Grenade Launcher
ENEMIES: Enemy base in the southwest corner.  Expect 20mm Taigas, Rocket 
Siberias and 105mm Pamirs from due south and west.  Late in the mission you'll
see Cossacks.  There's a mass of 50 Double 105mm Pamirs on the east edge of 
the map, but they won't attack until the end.
MISSION: This mission is all about fortification.  You'll have to move quickly
at the start, so slow the game down.  There are four groups of 20mm Tigers on
the map: one next to the WPC and the other three stationed with Small Towers 
to the south, east, and west.  Pull all of them back, group them together, and
switch them to Hold Position.  Very soon after you arrive, your Small Tower 
outposts to the south will fall.  Block the approaching horde with your 
starting troops; it'll be dear losses, but there's no help for that at this 
point.  The west outpost will drop a little later as an attacking squad drives
through.  Avoid building new defenders until you've researched the Tiger II 
and Double Chaingun upgrades.
 You can use the two Mammoths to help defend your base by erecting either 
walls and towers.  Enemy tanks often target walls in their initial charges, 
ignoring your troops momentarily and letting you take the advantage.  Watch
out for Cossacks, because they have slightly longer range than your towers and
can take them down without a scratch if you can't interrupt with Tigers.
 The other option is to surround your base with trenches.  It's possible, but 
it takes a full day if you know exactly what to do and longer if you have to 
figure it out.  Block all sides and close the ends off so the enemy tanks 
can't come down the middle and up the inside slope.  If you're trying this 
route, save often.  If you're successful, you'll see enemy tanks start piling 
up along the outside edge of the trenches.  The enemy will always seek out any
available weak spot, so keep the Tigers roving to block ferreting tanks and 
Cossacks.  Instead of digging trenches around your entire base, you can choose
to only trench the four approaches to your plateau marked by your Small Towers
at the beginning of the mission (west, south, and two east) but this is much 
more risky since you're putting your Mammoths directly in the line of fire and
you need at least one of them to survive to build an LZ.
 That's pretty much it for the mission.  Sit back and wait for the enemy to 
come to you.  Build up to the unit limit after you've finished the research.
Tigers won't be enough in the end and you should supplement them with Small
Towers with Double Chainguns for extra defense. Try to limit Small Towers to 
the minimum effective number since you won't be able to recoup this investment
at the end of the mission.  There will be constant attacks from the south and 
west, but preserve units by pulling heavily damaged tanks back.  
 At the end of the mission, shortly after the clock expires, your base will be
attacked by the mass of Pamirs on the east edge of the map.  If it's at all 
possible these will invade your base and make a mess of your evacuation.  
Trenches will block them, but you have to cover all four sides.  Even if they 
can't enter the base the Pamirs will sit on the cliff and shoot down on the 
WPC and Power Plant.
 When you finish the two days you receive 5000 credits and it will now be 
possible to build an LZ.  You should evacuate as many units as possible for 
their valuable experience; also, this mission has a higher unit limit than the
next few so the troops can carry over for immense effect.  At the same time, 
you're facing down an army of Pamirs, so you'll be bleeding out as well.

it through the Teleport.  When it comes out, it blows up itself, the Teleport,
a Research Center, and a Power Plant.  Flog your researchers and move on; 
there's literally nothing else you can do here.  For now.

ENEMIES: Enemy base dead center on map.  Expect the usual 20mm Taigas, 105mm
Pamirs, and Cossacks.
MISSION: Your first base is in the northeast corner of the map next to a very 
tiny mineral field.  You'll need a great deal more to fulfill your objectives,
so for now just drain it all into the Refinery for cash.  Start scouting with
the Mammoth west along the north edge of the map.  Pass a V at the north 
middle border and keep going until you reach a crevice in the northwest corner
running southwest.  Go due south and you should see a much larger field.  The 
disadvantage here is that the enemy base is immediately to the east, so you 
have to be very careful not to provoke them while you're vulnerable.  Set up 
the Power Plant, Ore Transport Base, Supply Depot and new LZ.  Move units here
as they arrive and pull the Harvesters over when they finish at the original 
base.  The first base will soon fall to an attack by Cossacks.  You can choose
to try to defend it, but it's not worthwhile.
 Defending the new base is relatively easy.  The east approach will be used by
most of the invading ground forces, but you should also watch the back 
entrance to the west and the north approach.  Sit back, keep your defenses up
with Small Towers against aerial attack, and wait it out.  It's quite simple 
to set up trenches on all three approaches at the narrow points so that no 
ground units can touch you at all - the ED will only send a handful of 
Cossacks at you in pairs once you take down the force that destroyed the 
original base.

OBJECTIVES: -Establish communication with the robots
   -Destroy all ED forces
TRANSPORT: Mammoth x1, Harvester x3, Condor x2, Tiger x4
RESEARCH: Spider I, Spider II, Spider III

   Gargoyle Rocket Launcher, 2x Gargoyle Rocket Launcher
   Repairer
ENEMIES:  Small enemy base in the center of the west map border.  Air assaults
will include both Cossacks and 20mm Groznys, land forces will add Laser 
Siberias to the familiar 20mm Siberias and 105mm Pamirs.
MISSION: When the UCS retreated from this region as the ED advanced, they left
behind some Trojan robots to be captured.  With their (minor) help, you're 
going to take the region back.  The robots are sitting in a small enclosure in
the ED base, and a few minutes into the mission they'll activate on their own
and go wild attacking the base.  They'll be crushed quickly, but you can order
them to concentrate fire for maximum damage.  
 This is the mission where you finally get Repairers and can bring all your 
troops back from the near-dead, but the enemy has Repairers as well and will 
do all it can to recover from repeated attacks.  Point is, kill things, don't 
wound them.  Enemy repairers will cluster to repair a single building or even
each other, which makes them much more effective.  They should be high on your
target priority list.
 As for actually running the mission, set up your base is on the middle of the
east border, northeast of the LZ.  Don't try to defend the LZ, just grab your 
shiny Rocket Tigers and head for the field.  You can choose to send the 
minerals to either a Refinery or Ore Transport Base at your discretion.
 This is the first mission you'll face Laser enemies.  Lasers, especially the
Triple Laser, will be the bane of your ground forces' existence until you 
discover Power Shield technology.  For now your units can take a hit or two,
but Triple Lasers will kill a Tiger in one hit.  Take out Laser defenses from 
the air to be safe.
 There are two approach corridors to this base: west and northwest.  Trench 
one of them for defense and let the enemy come to you.  Expect one or two 
waves of ground units and three or four flights of helicopters.  Every tank or
helicopter you blow up means your enemies are down resources, until they 
eventually run out altogether. 
 When there are no more attacks, make your way over to the enemy base and 
start whittling down enemy Small Towers and units.  If the unit limit permits,
build four Gargoyles and practice with air force tactics.  If it doesn't 
permit, kill a few of your Tigers to make room - yes, it's that important.  
Avoid the Large Towers and 20mm-armed buildings until you take the power grid 
down.  When the defenses finally drop, just mop up with air and ground units 
for experience.  If the mission doesn't end when the base dies, check the 
southwest corner of the map for stray Repairers.  Pull out everyone and 
everything - there's lots of valuable carryover on this mission.

      6. Stanford Lab 2
OBJECTIVES: -Test tunnel entrance
   -Test teleport
   -Destroy Test-Robot
TRANSPORT: empty
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: none	
MISSION: It's back to the lab again for another experiment.  Grab the test 
Tiger and order it down the TE, then bring it back up.  This time it doesn't
explode, which is an improvement.  Now send it to the teleport.  It arrives 
safely, but malfunctions and starts attacking the Power Plant.  You get a new
objective: kill the busted Tiger.  
 To kill your new enemy, find the three other Tigers near the research centers
and switch them to a Battle Unit script.  Now you've just got to get over to 
the other side of the river.  You're supposed to use the TE to go below, then
tunnel to the other side and build another TE, which costs 1000.  On the other
hand, you can build a bridge across the river for half that price.  Just click
the Narrow Bridge option under the Mammoth's defense tab and pick an anchor 
point on your side of the river, then the other straight across.  Bring the
security forces across and scrap the rebel.
 Don't end the mission yet.  The game gave you 5000 credits so you'd have 
enough to build the TE.  You can use the rest of the credits for research with
the centers provided on the lab map.  This is why it's important to leave some
research over from the last mission - otherwise these credits will be wasted.
Switch off your centers in the main base to burn through the mission map's 
resources faster.  End the mission when you hit zero.  The mission Mammoth 
can't build an LZ, so you can't carry over these units.  Remember to turn on 
the research center in your main base when you finish.

ENEMIES: 10 105mm Pamirs.  Really.  That's it.
MISSION: All you have to do for this mission is kill off the Pamirs that have 
attacked your base.  You can't do anything with the base because it's already
doomed by the time you get there.  Fortunately this small enemy group has 
absolutely no antiair capability, so you can bring your shiny Gargoyles in to
kill them all at zero risk for some experience.  You'll notice some artifacts 
spawning in the base; these are ammo crates since you don't get any support 
infrastructure for this mission.  Be careful when rearming Gargoyles because 
they are vulnerable when they land.  When the tanks are all dead, evacuate 
your air force and bring the free 10000 credits with you.  There's no way to 
prevent the transmission of the stolen plans.

   Repairer II
ENEMIES: Cossacks, Groznys, Rocket Pamirs, 20mm and Laser Siberias - you know,
the usual stuff.  Enemy bases due north of your south base, dead center on 
map, and north center, with a spare Shipyard in the northwest.
MISSION: If you played through the Eurasian Dynasty missions you know about
Neo, the super-secret yet vulnerable spy that can take over enemy units.  This
time you'll be on the other side of the equation and you'll see how much it 
sucks.
 You start with three Tigers at an LZ.  Immediately call the transport.  In a 
minute Neo will zap these Tigers and take control of the two on the right, 
which will kill the third.  Preempt this by siccing the two potential traitors
on each other so they'll be softened up when they turn and help them along 
with the spare.  The transport will be able to rescue this one before a group 
of ED tanks arrives and smashes the LZ.  Granted, losing one more Tiger isn't 
much at this point, but I don't like letting Neo win.  After Neo's performance
your superiors will order you to eliminate him as well.
 Switch to the other LZ.  Mark this one as Active, then send the Albatross to 
the main base and call it here before it arrives.  While you're waiting, set 
up your research: the Repairer upgrade is the highest priority, followed by
Large Towers and then the rocket tracking upgrades.  This mission gives you 
the Shark chassis for free with the option to upgrade your navy, but I 
discourage that for reasons stated above.  Minelayers are nice, but I don't 
find myself using them often.
 After the Albatross shows up and unloads, set up your base just west of the 
LZ.  The mineral field south of the LZ should be funnelled into an Ore 
Transport Base.  By this point you should be up to two Aerial Supply Depots
and four Condors if you've been carrying over your Tigers.  There's another
very small mineral field to the northwest that makes an excellent spot for a
Refinery - use Energy Transmitters to power it.
 This is the first mission where you can put a navy to use and in honor of 
the occasion you've been granted the basic Shark chassis for free.  If you 
want to use the navy you're free to, but you won't be able to carry over the 
ships you build to the next mission.  Ever.
 After you've had a few minutes to prepare, Rocket Pamirs and Laser Siberias
will start rolling into the base through the tiny north gap.  It's fairly easy
to defend.  When you finish researching the Repairer upgrade, build a new 
Repairer and tell it to upgrade any existing Repairers so they can all do 
field upgrades, then start working on upgrading all of your Tigers to better 
specs.
 There won't be many enemy attacks; for the most part they'll stay home until 
you show up, then assault in droves.  Watch out for more Lasers this time 
around, which can kill a Tiger in two hits.  To compensate, focus on using 
your Gargoyles more for luring them out and taking down defenses.  When they
start taking damage, bolt for your ground support.
 The first base due north of yours is defended by lots of air units and Rocket
Pamirs, which makes it dangerous for your air force when you first arrive.  
Whittle them down and start killing off the structure defenses: a line of 
towers on the south approach and the three power plants.  Use the ground 
forces to mop up and move the air force northeast to find a developed but 
undefended mineral field.  Scrape the ED and their detritus off and you can 
use it for your own with enough Energy Transmitters.
 The bigger problem is the base at the center of the map that protects Neo.  
You know the location of his Headquarters from the mission briefing, and the 
stolen plans are conveniently sitting next to it for you to collect.  The only
defenses immediately around the HQ are several Laser and 20mm Small Towers 
that shouldn't be too much trouble, but attacking them brings down all the 
enemy forces from the northwest.  Withdraw and repair as necessary; enemy 
helicopters won't.
 Be careful not to attack the Research Center next to the HQ until you've made
preparations.  Also make sure that you collect the stolen plans (the rotating
artifact next to the HQ) before you destroy either the HQ or the Research 
Center to prevent them from becoming corrupted.  When you destroy the center 
Neo will attack and convert all your units to use against you.  You can 
minimize the damage by moving most of your units to the main base where they 
will be safe or simply holding them in the Albatross.  Whatever unit(s) you 
use will be lost, and since the area is only accessible from the air that 
means losing one of your highly experienced Gargoyles unless you build a 
sacrificial lamb.  If you lose this mission because you leave too many units 
on the field for Neo to take and they destroy your base, proceed to New York.

RESEARCH: Harvester III
   Plasma Cannon, 2x Plasma Cannon
ENEMIES: The LC base is northeast of map center and will send Rocket and Sonic
Moons and 20mm Meteors your way.  There is a satellite mining colony along the
east edge of the map.
MISSION: This is the first time you face the Lunar Corporation in combat.  
You'll have to build an LZ at the start of the mission, but you have enough
time and resources to import defenses before you start seeing combat.  The
first raid arrives shortly after the Albatross and should be easily repulsed
with the aid of the Small Towers.
 Ostensibly the purpose of this mission is to test the Plasma Cannon, but it's
not an actual requirement.  You have to research it yourself.  Unfortunately,
now that you've finally got an energy weapon the LC will be using shields, 
somewhat dulling your cutting-edge technology.
 When you've got your army prepared, move north-northeast to the coast.  LC
units gather here before they move on your base, and you can take them out 
before they become a threat.  Move east with a few units and scrape LC mines 
off a third mineral field before they suck up too much.
 Wresting this field reduces the LC to meager resources, making the rest of 
the mission extremely simple.  Because the path to their base curves down from
the north, they have virtually no defenses to the south.  Let your air force
fly over the water and take out the power structures.  Remember that to kill
the power for the LC you have to take down both Solar Power Plants and Solar
Batteries.  Without resources the LC won't field many units and the base 
should be an easy kill.  In its death throes, the LC will send you a message
that they are surrendering all their structures and units to you and are 
seeking alliance negotiations - not that they give you anything useful.
 Make sure all your units are at full ammo and extract them.  If you moved 
quickly to kill the satellite mine, you can leave one Harvester behind with an
Ore Transport Base to funnel 300000 (!) credits to your spaceship.

ENEMIES: Small enemy bases on the mineral field north of your LZ, east of map
center, and far north.  There are only a handful of 105mm and Rocket Pamirs
with Cossacks and 20mm Groznys for air support.
MISSION: This mission runs slightly differently from what you're used to.  You
don't have control of the LZ at the start, just six Rocket Spiders.  Move them
east to descend to the lake, then west to the mineral field.  There are two 
Mines and Refineries here protected by Small Towers and a few Pamirs that will
sweep down from the north as you attack.  The Spiders are mostly doomed 
because they can't rearm, so don't sweat it.
 As soon as you kill the first Small Tower the LZ comes online.  Call the 
transport and the backups should arrive just as the Spiders gasp their last.  
Let the Gargoyles sweep over the mountains and knock out the base.  Kill the 
power first so that the Mines don't hog all the minerals.
 You have to provide your own startup funds for the base.  Keep it bare-bones 
because there's no profit to be made here: Ore Transport Base, Power Plant, 
and an Aerial Supply Depot.  Send your air force north to clear a small group
of Towers and Pamirs, then east to the ED base.  Draw out the Groznys for a 
slaughter, then circle and kill the power.  The prototypes you're looking for
are on the east platform, but you can't do anything with them yet.
 Head for the north border of the map and kill the last ED structures.  There
is an ED Tunnel Entrance here that you can use if you restrain yourself from 
blowing it up; in that case you'll have to build your own.  Underground, you 
can find some ammo crates to the northeast.  The activation device is in the 
southeast.  As soon as you pick it up, the Grizzlies come under your command.
Change Script to a Battle Unit so you can use them in combat.
 After you secure the Grizzlies you'll be ordered to destroy the ED base.  
Since you already did that, you immediately win the mission.  Extract 
everything.

ENEMIES: A whole bunch of Rocket Grizzlies.
MISSION: Seriously, I have no idea how you're supposed to beat this mission.
You get here if Neo managed to destroy your base in Japan and therefore 
escaped.  He then turns your experimental Grizzlies against you and lets them
loose against the New York manufacturing district.  You start with about nine
20mm Tigers scattered across the map and more Harvesters than you'll need, 
plus two Mammoths.  The Grizzlies come from across the southern bridge and 
from southwest of the first VPC.
 You can use the Mammoth by the first VPC to build an LZ and start bringing in
carryover units immediately.  Unfortunately, between LZ construction and 
Albatross transport time they won't arrive until the southern contingent of 
Grizzlies is already chewing on your southernmost VPC.  You can slow them down
a little bit by grouping all your Harvesters at the beginning of the mission 
and using them to block the bridge.  I'd also suggest upgrading all the base
defenses with Rocket Launchers instead of 20mms and building more Towers to 
supplement ground forces.
 The problem is that the Grizzlies are just too tough.  These things have 3600
HP and 75% armor, making it nearly impossible for 20mms to take them out.  
Grenade and Rocket Launchers stand a better chance, but I didn't have enough 
of them to carry over.  The Grizzlies are using both a Heavy and Small Rocket 
Launcher each, which allows them to tear through all of your units like toilet
paper.  They might run short of ammo eventually, but they have 220 rounds to 
start with.  You don't have enough firepower to sever the south bridge and 
strand them.  By the time the Albatross returns with the second load of 
carryover units the second Grizzly contingent is already attacking the north 
VPC even though I'd only destroyed one of the southern Grizzlies.
 The only thing that might be possible is to use Great Lakes to build up an 
enormous force of Plasma Cannons.  These might be able to destroy Grizzlies 
fast enough, since they deal quadruple the damage of 20mms.  If this actually 
works, let me know.

ENEMIES: One base located when you arrive, the other directly south of the LC
base with two walls of towers blocking the way in.  20mm Groznys, Rocket 
Pamirs, and Laser Caspians are the cannon fodder this time.
MISSION: You're provided with Plasma Spiders this time, which should be 
more useful than the Rocket Spiders from Kurshatov FZ since the ED doesn't 
have shields yet.  The LC will send an Electro Moon down to negotiate.  You 
must protect this unit and the UCS delegate Minelayer without the ability to 
move them until negotiations are completed.  
 Get your LZ moving as quickly as possible.  There will be attacks on the 
negotiations soon after you arrive and the Plasma Spiders aren't enough by 
themselves.  Laser Caspians can take out your unshielded units in one hit; 
counter with Laser-immune Grizzlies, Gargoyles, or defensive structures.  Tap
the mineral field since you're already here.
 After a few minutes negotiations will be completed and you can move both the
Moon and Minelayer.  Your new objective is to escort the Moon back to the LC
base in the north.  Pull them back into your base and start plotting a course
through the ED emplacements.  Use your air force to scout ahead: there are 
Towers and Pillboxes all over the passage to the first base that have to be 
disabled.  You'll get a message from Neo again, but he doesn't seem to do 
anything except threaten.
 The first base serves as the mineral source for the ED, so if you can halt 
mining in the west you should stop them from producing units.  Keep your 
ground forces close by to clear defenses after your air force kills the power 
so the ED can't build new Power Plants.  By now you should have no trouble 
destroying 20mm defenses and Power Plants with the UCSAF.  However, it's
unlikely you'll be able to drain much of this mineral field because the LC 
seems to drop Mines on it pretty quickly.
 After the first base goes down, repeat the performance for the second.  
Without resources they won't be able to build new units, making this a quick 
kill.  Make sure you take out _all_ the towers before you send the Moon back
to its base just to be safe.  If the Moon is destroyed you can still continue
the game, but go to Madagascar (w/o LC allies) instead of the next mission.  I
strongly recommend going with the alliance because it gives you access to much
more mineral wealth.

ENEMIES: One large ED base on the northeast corner of the island spewing 105mm

MISSION: With your new alliance to the LC come some responsibilities.  You are
dispatched to Madagascar to defend the LC base here against encroaching ED 
forces.  In this mission, as in any alliance, you and the LC have shared 
vision.  The game provides you with a few Rocket Tigers and Plasma Spiders to 
start, plus an LZ and TE.  Ignore the TE for now and set up your base on the
northwest mineral field.
 The air force is again critical in this mission because it gives you the 
necessary mobility for the fantastic distances involved.  Don't worry about 
the LC base, they've got more than enough defenses to handle themselves until 
you cripple the ED.  Bring in the army for ground crew while the Gargoyles 
start chipping at the west side of the ED base.  Attacking the west side is 
preferable because this is the location of the ED mineral field; without it 
they won't be able to replace Power Plants and destroyed units.  Don't let 
your Gargoyles get bogged down destroying Pillboxes, just gut the power and 
Small Towers and move east.  
 After the ED base goes down the LC offers you Power Shield technology as a 
reward.  To collect it send a unit down your TE and follow the tunnels to the
spot underneath the LC base.  Your target is the blue computer core and 
collecting it will complete your objectives.  There are also six artifacts
southwest of the core that can impart shields to your units, but they won't
work on Tigers.

ENEMIES: One large ED base at the center of the south border.  In addition to 
Rocket Pamirs and Laser Caspians you'll be facing Minelayers, Kruszchevs, and 
even possibly Urals.
MISSION: You're working with the LC again, this time to attack an ED base - 
not much different from last time.  Unload your transport and set up a 
minimalist base with an Ore Transport Base since you won't need the credits.
Group your Gargoyles and fly them southeast to find a Minelayer.  Yep, the ED
has mined the approach from your base and the only way to get ground units in 
without losing a few is to lead with a Minelayer that can detect and destroy 
them.  However, you don't want to have a lot of units on the field for reasons
that will become clear.  Send all your units except for the Harvesters, 
Repairer, Gargoyles, and maybe a couple of Tigers back to the main base.  
 Taking the base apart with your Gargoyles is really pretty easy because by 
now they should be experienced enough to take out any 20mm emplacements 
without getting scratched.  Even the Groznys the ED occasionally throws at you
won't really be a problem if you kill them quickly.  The only potential 
difficulty is preventing ED tanks from leaving their base to attack your 
almost-defenseless one.  Blast them as they cross the minefield and be advised
that they can sometimes go straight north instead of northwest.  Killing the 
ED Mines is your priority.
 Eventually the LC will get its act together and attack.  When this happens, 
pull back all your units into the Albatross.  For some reason the ED defensive
structures won't fire on the LC so they can destroy the base slowly but 
surely.  While they're doing that, though, you'll get a message from Neo and 
he'll turn all your units against you.  If they're in the Albatross he doesn't
get anything.  
 Pull the Gargoyles back out to clear any stray Minelayers and help tear down 
the base and leave one Harvester on the field.  When you complete the 
objective the field is clear of enemy units and the Harvester will credit your
main base with about 150K credits for the project.
 If you were interested, yes it's possible to kill LC units and structures, 
and no there aren't any apparent repercussions.  I'm not sure what happens if 
you destroy the entire LC base after the mission is complete but I doubt it 
has any effect.

      15. Egypt
OBJECTIVES: -Destroy ED forces
   -Destroy LC forces
TRANSPORT: Gargoyle x4, Harvester x3
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: Large enemy base in the southeast corner fielding Rocket Pamirs, 
Laser Caspians, 105mm and Ion Kruszchevs, and a fully functional navy.  LC 
base in the northeast corner with Sonic, Rocket, and Electro Moons and Craters
and 20mm Meteors.
MISSION: It's time for another joint ED-bashing mission.  You're in the 
southwest corner of the map, the ED is in the southeast and must cross the 
river, and the LC is in the northeast corner guarding the bridge.  To really 
take this mission by storm takes some planning.
 First, get over your joy of being provided with three Plasma and four Rocket
Panthers.  The order of business while the Albatross is in transit is to set 
up the usual Power Plant, Ore Transport Base, and Aerial Supply Depot x2.  Arm
the depots with rocket launchers and put up a Fortress on the northeast corner
of your base.  When the Albatross arrives disembark the Gargoyles and get the
Harvesters flowing, then cram the Panthers back into the Albatross and send 
them home with 5000 credits.  You should now have only the Harvesters, 
Gargoyles, a Mammoth, and maybe a Repairer on the mission map.
 With the base under construction send the Mammoth north-northwest into a 
valley with a long east-west tomb.  You should see two mini-sphinxes and two
obelisks in front of it.  Put in a TE here and send the Mammoth down.  The 
tomb tunnels are obvious but surrounded by bedrock; to crack into them burrow
southwest to the end of the passage.
 While the Mammoth is digging send the Gargoyles northeast to the LC base.  
First sever two squares from the bridge near the map border to prevent the ED
from having any possibility of launching a ground assault across the river.
Yes, they could repair it with a Gruz, but they don't do that.  ED units will
start attacking - focus on taking out the Caspians and Groznys, the Kruszchevs
are a bit beyond the capabilities of Gargoyles.  After the immediate assault 
is over it's time to stab your partner in the back.  Destroy all three LC
Refineries - yes, I'm serious.  When they try to rebuild, blow them up before
they hit the ground.  Eventually they'll stop trying.
 This is the first mission you can see the ED Ion Cannon.  It won't be much of
a threat to you because the ground forces are stopped with the bridge broken,
but if you allow ED tanks through you'll see just how annoying it can be.  
Retrofitting all your buildings with shields isn't cheap, but only a few shots
are necessary to hobble your entire base.  Your units won't get off much 
easier.
 Meanwhile your Mammoth should have managed to break into the Pharaoh's tomb.
Down here are a total of nine spinning $s worth a total of 90K free credits.
The first one is just down the hall from your entry point, then go northeast 
to the room just east of your TE through the bedrock.  Grab two pickups here 
and head east to the crossroads.  Get three more in the south burial chamber,
then take the north path and work your way northwest through the warren to get
the last three.  Take your Mammoth back up and send it to the Albatross.
 Take a look down south toward the ED base.  Watch for the LC to make an 
attack against the ED fortifications and get crushed.  After this happens you 
have a few minutes to move your units back to the Albatross to protect them 
(including the Harvesters).  You guessed it: Neo sends you a message and 
captures all your units on the map.  If everyone's already in the main base or
Albatross he doesn't get anything.  Unfortunately that's not enough; a few 
minutes later the LC claims that you double-crossed them and that the alliance
is severed.  In theory this is because your combat units captured by Neo 
attacked the LC, but it takes place even if Neo doesn't get any units and even
if you didn't take out the LC's Refineries.  There is nothing you can do to 
prevent Neo's attack or the cancellation of the alliance.  Oh well.
 Now that Neo is behind you it's time to pull in your units from the main 
base.  Your main weapon is still going to be your air force unless you choose 
to rebuild the bridge to the LC base.  Also build two new Rocket Bats for 
long-range aerial assaults.
 Defense shouldn't be a major issue because the LC has no resources since you
destroyed the Refineries and the ED exhausted their offensive drive on the LC 
early on.  I recommend starting with the ED base because they're closer and 
therefore much easier for your Bats and Gargoyles to resupply, plus you can 
stop them from draining the field and secure some extra resources for yourself
if you move quickly.  Take out the navy first, as for some reason they don't 
try to escape if you engage them from outside their range with the Rocket 
Bats.  Let the Bats handle antiaircraft defensive emplacements.  You can 
choose to gut this base and then mop it with ground forces later after it's 
helpless or take it down entire with the air force.  If you choose to rebuild
the bridge and bring ground forces down, watch out for mines on the approach
between the LC and ED - sweep thoroughly with a Minelayer to take them out.
 After the ED is toast head for the LC.  They're completely broke and 
shouldn't provide much of a challenge.  If necessary move your army to the 
north central island with the mineral field so your air force can retreat to 
cover and repair if the LC units start dogging you.  After both bases go down 
you can evacuate everyone and send all the resources to your spaceship.  Skip
to Mozambique.

ENEMIES: LC base at map center with 20mm Meteors and Rocket, Sonic, and 
Electro Moons and Lunars.  ED base at northeast corner with Cossacks and 20mm
Groznys, Laser, Rocket, and 20mm Siberias, and 105mm and Rocket Pamirs.  
They're also allied against you.
MISSION: Take the starting forces northwest to secure the mineral field.  Both
the ED and LC will invade from the northeast with both air and ground forces,
so focus any defenses in this direction.  
 Technically you don't have to attack the enemy bases.  The computer is 
underground and you'll need to tunnel to reach it.  You can build a TE in your
base and then dig all the way to the core under the LC base, but it will take
a long time.  
 Your other option is to beat back the attacking waves and take the fight to 
the LC base.  Destroy it and build a TE at map center to easily access the 
core.  If you do this, note that the mountains protect the LC from ground 
assault except for a narrow northeast corridor.  Wander too far north and 
you'll hit the ED base with painful results.  They don't have much in the way
of units, but the Towers and Pillboxes are more than enough for defense.  The
LC power structures are at the south end of their base and therefore make easy
targets for your air force.
 After you hit the core you can end the mission.  There is no need to destroy 
either ED or LC forces or bases.

ENEMIES: Large ED production facility in the southwest corner building 
Cossacks and 20mm Groznys, Laser, Rocket, and 20mm Siberias, and Rocket and
105mm Pamirs.  Large-scale defensive emplacements east of your base and in the
northwest corner with a Headquarters each.
MISSION: The mission briefing this time around is quite deceptive because it 
implies that you're building up defenses to stop an imminent ED attack.  While
the ED will attack they won't use one gigantic push, nor will it likely be 
enough to break through even the defenses that are built by default.  The only
ground approach to your central plateau is the slope on the south side that is
already guarded by two Fortresses and various Towers.  You do have to build 
Energy Transmitters to make sure that all of these are online and ASDs for 
ammo.
 The other thing is that you don't want to keep any units in this mission 
unless absolutely necessary.  Neo's back again and he'll hit you twice to 
switch your units to ED control.  The first time is about 26 game hours into 
the mission, then again 26 hours after that.  In between you are free to build
new Towers if necessary (especially over the mineral field on the southwest 
side), mine, and fend off attacks with the air force as long as you can get 
all your units back into the Albatross right before the Neo song-and-dance.
 Your Harvesters start at a mineral field below the plateau connected by a TE.
Immediately pull them back and send them to work on the southwest field.  In
theory you should be able to use command queues to get them mining through the
tunnel but I can't seem to get it to work.  Power down the TEs so ED units 
can't use them to dodge your defenses.
 Attacks from the ED will be relatively weak and sporadic.  Every once in a 
while a few Pamirs and Siberias will come up the south slope but they should
be easily stopped by all the defenses posted there.  If you feel nervous you 
can block the passage entirely with Walls and take the tanks out from the air.
Also watch for Cossacks and Groznys flying in from the southwest.
 After Neo's second assault bring in all your units.  Taking out the two 
satellite HQs in the northwest corner and on the east side is very easy since
they don't have any mobile units, allowing you to use your experienced units'
range to destroy all Towers and Pillboxes without taking a hit.  The southwest
base is slightly harder, but shouldn't pose much of a challenge either.  Note
that even though your objective is to defend your own base, to satisfy it you
must destroy all enemy structures and forces.  After you accomplish this you 
can mine both of the large fields near your base plus whatever is left at the
ED base.  From here proceed directly to Mozambique.

ENEMIES: Enemy base 3/4 up the west border primarily minding its own business.
Expect most of your attacks to come from the base on the north central border:
20mm Cossacks and Groznys and 105mm, Laser, and Ion Kruszchevs.  The west base
may field some Thors for target practice.
MISSION: Neo's little stunt in Egypt (or Australia) was the final straw.  Now 
your superiors want him dead and it's your job to make it happen.  Boy, this 
sounds like a great idea.
 Your base this time is located in a valley between two severe cliffs.  Two 
pairs of Teleports link your valley to the tops of the cliffs.  First things
first: autodestruct the Teleport and Energy Transmitter on the west cliff.  
There's nothing up here that you want to get to and it will serve as a passage
into your base for enemy tanks.  On the east cliff is a mineral field you'll 
want to tap, but this is also a target for enemy tanks.  For now set up a 
Power Plant, Ore Transport Base, and two Fortresses to defend the field.  
Don't depend on Energy Transmitters because they get blown up too easily.  
Feel free to retrofit the Fortresses with Plasma Cannons since the ED still 
doesn't have shields and aircraft won't approach from this direction.  Don't 
start mining the field yet; with Neo on the map you should know better.
 I had a few problems operating the Teleports on this mission.  When the ED 
attacked I switched off the west cliff Teleport so they couldn't transport 
down, but after I turned it on it never worked again.  Instead I built a TE 
in the valley and tunneled east, then built another TE.
 As for the base itself, set up a trench across the north approach to block 
all tanks, two Aerial Supply Depots, and a few extra towers with AA 20mms or 
Rockets.  The only thing you have to worry about actually hitting your base
is aircraft because tanks are blocked by the trench to the north, the cliff to
the west, and the Fortresses and cliff to the east (turn off the Teleport when
they approach).  Send the Spiders home and leave only the UCSAF and a Repairer
on the map.
 As soon as they disembark send the Gargoyles north to a small cul-de-sac 
guarded by ED Small Towers.  Blow the towers and the Tunnel Entrances they're 
protecting.  This stops the north ED base from being able to dispatch units 
underground, giving you a bit more warning if you watch the west and east 
approaches.  Don't try to stop the Kruszchevs with the UCSAF - Gargoyles can't
deal damage fast enough and Bats aren't good with moving targets.
 Neo will steal your units twice during this mission.  I can't pinpoint the 
time to any particular event, but the second one did happen just after a large
mass of white (north base) tanks assembled on the west cliff.  All I can say 
is to save often in different files until it happens, then reload and store 
your units in the Albatross.  I'd estimate that the two events are separated 
by about a game day.  As soon as Neo's second event triggers it is safe to 
move all your units into the mission area.
 Now that you are feeling confident send the UCSAF northwest to the first 
enemy base.  Usually there's a crowd of Repairers or combat units outside the 
gates that make for easy pickings.  Swing west to the map border to break 
through Small Towers easily and use the gap to get at the base's soft 
underbelly.  Keep Bats hammering the front gates and their defensive 
structures from range.  Don't bother destroying the entire base, just gut it
for now.
 Turn your attention to the base at the north border of the map now.  Most of 
the defenses are along the east edge, so approach from the west with air 
units.  For some reason the ED lined a sheer cliff that's impassable to ground
units with Lasers that are helpless against your Gargoyles and Bats.  Look for
a Headquarters surrounded by Small Towers and wipe it out to satisfy the "kill
Neo" objective with 96.8% certainty.
 Now just tear the two bases apart.  This can take a while simply because the
distances involved you down as the UCSAF flies back and forth to rearm.  To 
save time flatten your trench and send the army to destroy the west base.  
After all the structures go down you'll receive a message that Neo's body 
hasn't been found.
 If you've been truly diligent about sending resources to Project Mars this 
mission will provide the last minerals you need to finish the spaceship.  
Leave a Harvester for automining and you should satisfy the limit sometime in
the next mission.  On the other hand if you aren't particularly close to your
goal, don't worry too much because you've still got three more missions that 
will provide minimum 300K to your coffers.

ENEMIES: Two enemy bases on the north side of the map: ED to the east, LC to
the west, and both of them pissed at you.  Expect 20mm Meteors, Cossacks, and
Groznys and some Sonic Thunderers for air cover; 20mm, Rocket, and Electro 
Lunars and Moons; 120mm, Laser, Rocket, and Ion Kruszchevs; and Laser, Rocket,
and Ion Siberias.
MISSION: It's time to get your act together.  You're here because you haven't
been sending enough resources to Project Mars.  If you can't get enough 
resources to it between here, Columbia, and Achimania, you lose.  
Incidentally, don't be afraid of the alarmist weather report you receive at 
the beginning of the mission; the real clock is the one at the top of the 
screen in your main base, and no matter what the video tells you there are 
still that many days remaining before the earth explodes.  
 Your base starts with only four Plasma Spiders, a Mammoth, a Power Plant, and
an LZ.  Call the Albatross and build an OTR on the west side.  This field 
won't provide all the minerals you need, but it's a good start.  If you build 
any defensive structures focus them on the slope to the west; all ground units
will use this approach and air units will come down the valley right next to 
it.
 When your air force arrives send it to the map's center to find a large 
mineral field.  There are a handful of ED Small Towers that will go down 
easily.  Then head north-northeast to the ED base and take out the mining 
operation.  You can do this by destroying all the Mines and preventing new 
ones from being completed or killing all the Taigas so they can't transport
containers to the Refinery.  When the operation goes down the ED will become
completely crippled and you don't have to worry about attacks from them.  
Don't bother destroying the base because a) it's mined, b) it's unnecessary to
satisfy your objectives, and c) it's a waste of time.
 After the ED base drops you can freely move to assault the LC base to the 
west.  Power structures are at the north and south ends.  It is much more 
difficult to stop the LC from building new structures because they don't need 
a constructor unit, so feel free to withdraw.
 Alternately you can choose not to attack the base at all.  If you sit on the 
central mineral field eventually the LC will empty their field and start 
trying to mine there.  Put a few antiair defenders around the field and you 
can destroy them in the air at great expense to the LC.  Don't leave any units
on the field itself while you're doing this because when LC structures drop 
they destroy any units underneath them (even though the LC can't build over 
your units, if you wander under during construction they are destroyed).
 Between the base field and the central field you'll have no trouble hitting 
the objective.  Clearing the map of enemy units can be very time-consuming, 
but doing so ensures that you'll be able to automine an enormous amount of 
resources.

Groznys; Sonic Thunderers; 120mm, Ion, and Laser Kruszchevs and Urals; and 
20mm, Rocket, and Electro Lunars and Moons.
MISSION: Just like the Andes, only easier.  You'll have to use Energy 
Transmitters to reach the field east of your base, but again that won't be 
enough to fulfill the objective.  Throw up a few rocket defenses around the 
Power Plant just in case.  You get another free Grizzly and some Plasma 
Panthers and Rocket Spiders for defense.
 The LC will send a medium-sized tank force at you early in the mission so 
make sure you have enough combat units in the Albatross to deal with it.  The
starting units won't be enough on their own.  Expect LC and ED tanks from the 
south, LC air units from the west, and ED air units from the east.  Tanks will
have to drive past the central mineral field to reach you base, allowing you 
to engage them away from the main base.  You'll also see a large-scale raid by
Thunderers that can be quite destructive, but after that the LC runs out of 
minerals.
 Send the Gargoyles to map center to secure the large field.  I don't 
recommend trying to attack either of the enemy bases because they start 
entrenched and the mineral facilities are on the far sides.  Mining this field
will be necessary and you can get a start by bringing in three more Harvesters
and setting up a satellite mining operation while the first field is still 
running.  Put up Towers if absolutely necessary.

MISSION: Get all the minerals you need because the Earth is about to go boom.
There's a small field within your base, another one to the south, another 
small one at map center, and the fields beneath the two enemy bases.  The 
three you have access to should be more than enough as long as you can defend 
them.
 The starting units this time are shockingly outdated.  Plasma Tigers and 
Rocket Spiders won't be enough to stop the large LC attack that hits right 
after the Albatross arrives.  You also have to build a Power Plant to get the
base up and running.  Use Energy Transmitters to extend power south and mine
the second field.
 Keep your units pointing west to stop approaching LC and ED heavy tanks.  
Some air units may approach over the southern mountains but they shouldn't be 
a major threat.  Mine until you hit the campaign objective and see the closing
movie.

ENEMIES: Large ED base on the north border of the map fielding 105mm Pamirs 
and 20mm Taigas and defended by Small Towers.
MISSION: First one's always easy, but this will be slightly harder than the ED
and UCS versions because there's no way to avoid combat.  Luckily you're 
provided with the Fang, an alien vehicle offered by the UCS to the LC as a 
good-faith present.  Why they didn't keep it for themselves is a mystery.  In
any case, this is the personal vehicle of YOU, the general, so if it gets 
blown up the campaign ends because you're DEAD.  You can leave it on a mission
after it ends, but then you lose it.
 You may notice that the LC only requires 500k minerals, while the ED and UCS
both needed 1m.  The reason is that the LC is free to mine all of the moon 
with impunity, but the moon lacks certain heavy metals that can only be 
extracted on earth.  For those who were interested.
 From the LZ head due northwest to find the mineral field.  Drop an Ore 
Transport Refinery, Solar Power Plant, Solar Cells, and Solar Battery for now.
Don't explore, just keep mining.
 Eventually you'll get a message that enemy troops are in the area and you 
should prepare defenses.  To be clear, "defenses" mean an Aerial Supply Center
(1500) plus a Mercury (400) or two.  That's 2000 credits that would be much 
better served in your main base for research.  Units you build can be 
constructed in the main base and ferried over in the Jupiter.
 Instead, I choose to use the Fang as a damage magnet and lead defender.  As
long as it doesn't move, it's not threatened in any way by the ED forces 
because of its rapid regeneration.  Two shots from the Fang will kill a Pamir,
three will kill a Taiga.  The Lunars will die very quickly if you allow them 
into combat, so keep them back for support fire.  The Rocket Lunars will run
out of ammo quickly, but whether to build an Aerial Supply Center or just send
them to the Jupiter when they run out is up to you.  The Fang's ammo 
replenishes itself over time.
 As long as the Ore Transport Refinery stays functional the minerals keep 
flowing the the main base.  Even after the End Mission globe appears you can 
keep overmining if you're patient for a full 30,750 CR.  Pull the survivors
out and go home.

ENEMIES: A steady stream of 105mm Pamirs, 20mm Taigas, and Gruzs throughout

MISSION: Unlike Ural, this time defenses will be a constant problem.  You also
get access to several important researches like the Defender and Meteor.  I 
don't actually recommend building Meteors for this mission because Lunars are 
much cheaper and the air element isn't necessary, but research them after the 
Double Chaingun, Defender, and Rocket 25%.
 You start with a small base and three 20mm Lunars.  Build an LZ immediately 
and pull the Jupiter in with the Fang for backup - Lunars will be dropping 
like flies throughout this mission.  They're cheap, speedy little buggers, but
have no armor and will get pulverized by a couple of 20mms or a single 105mm.
Also build 3-4 Lunars to supplement starting forces and another Mercury.  Drop
a couple of Ore Transport Refineries on the mineral field.
 First you'll see a Gruz invading to build a Mine on your territory.  Take it 
out with the Lunars, but don't pursue.  Shortly afterward you'll be visited by
a few Pamirs that will show you just how easily those Lunars will explode.  If
you didn't build extra Lunars and the Jupiter hasn't arrived yet the Pamirs
will quickly crush existing defenses and move on your buildings.
 Beat back the attackers and set up a defensive line with Laser Walls on the 
northwest opening.  Drop the laser beam (by selecting one Wall and clicking on
the next one) when enemies attack so you can defend it.  Fang may hit level 10
experience in this mission if you're keeping it on the front line.  Research 
but don't build Meteors; you don't need them for this defensive mission.  Mine
the field up to the limit and overmine if you feel comfortable continuing to 
defend.

ENEMIES: One large enemy base at the center of the map, 20mm Small Towers all

MISSION: This one's odd because it's addressed to an LC contact within the ED
named Igor Burkov instead of your main general.  That doesn't mean much though
because you still must use the Fang if you're going to satisfy the mission 
requirements.
 All you have for the mission is an LZ on the south edge of the map - no 
startup funds.  Pull in the Jupiter and drop off Fang for the messenger run.
The UCS base that is your goal is in the northeast corner of the map, but the 
land routes in the way are blocked by ED walls and tanks.  There are actually
two walls: to the northwest from your TB and on the west border of the map. 
Cut a hole through the northwest one and get ready to run.
 There's absolutely no way to dodge the damage you'll be taking as the 
Cossacks and Pamirs descend, so just keep moving northeast.  Ignore the 
buildings as much as possible until you hit a line of 20mm Small Towers backed
up by Pamirs.  Blow up one or two of the towers so you can bolt through and 
keep running northeast.  Get inside the UCS base and the Gargoyles, Tigers, 
and structure weapons take out the ED troops following you.  This fulfills 
objective #1.
 Sit in the UCS base long enough to regenerate your HP to full because you're
dashing back.  Make sure the Jupiter is waiting for you at the TB before you
run back again.  The ED will have replaced the lost units and will be chasing
you again - move fast.  Climb into the Jupiter and the pursuing units will 
back off.  Return the Fang to the main base and end the mission.

ENEMIES: You should very be used to 105mm Pamirs, 20mm Siberias, and 20mm 
Cossacks by now.  The bases are on the west and south borders of the map.
MISSION: Get moving quickly because your mission forces won't be able to hold 
their ground for long.  There are five Rocket Lunars, but even with 25% 
Rockets they have quite poor accuracy.  Worse, a Gruz invades your base early 
on and they'll waste all their ammo missing it and then taking out any 
structures in progress, leaving you defenseless.
 For now just sit in the base and watch your enemies roll in.  There are three
ground approaches: over the bridge to the south and two passes to the west and
southwest.  Blow a section out of the bridge and block the passes with Laser
Walls and Defenders.  Let the Lunars retreat when they take damage so they can
recover.  Remember that the Fang can't fire at Cossacks.  
 You can choose to win this mission with either the army or the air force.  
For the ground war, wait until the Moon and Rocket Launcher upgrades are 
completed - Lunars are just too fragile.  Alternately you can build four 20mm
Meteors and use them for surgical strikes to weaken the base before mopping 
with the Lunars and Fang.
 Either way your target is the south base.  There are many Cossacks defending
it, but drop those and a few 20mm Small Towers and the air force is completely
safe.  Wipe out the structures and you'll get mission complete.  Taking out 
the west base for experience is entirely optional.  Make absolutely certain 
that all your combat units are at full ammo before you leave this map!

ENEMIES: One enemy base at roughly the 9:30 position on the minimap guarded by
105mm Large Towers and 20mm Cossacks, plus a few 20mm Small Towers posted 
along your route and scattered 105mm Pamirs.
MISSION: This one runs different from anything you've seen before.  You don't
get a base or any startup funds, you can't build any buildings, but you are 
required to engage in combat.  The reason you had to reload all your combat 
units last mission is because you don't have a Supply Depot on this map and 
they'll be stuck with the ammo left over from last time.  
 The mission briefing lays it out: the UCS has asked for an escort for three
Mammoths from their north base (north of the LZ) to their south base.   At 
least two of the three must survive to the destination.
 Pull four Meteors out to the mission first with Fang and either Lunars or 
Moons, whichever you've got.  Leave the ground forces at the LZ for the moment
and head for the south base with the air force.  Sweep north along a bridge 
and kill off four 20mm Small Towers, then a mob of 105mm Pamirs.  They can't 
hurt you but they may bolt as they take damage.  If your Meteors are using 
rockets they'll run out of ammo quickly and become useless.
 After the second half of the route is clear go for the ED base to the 
northwest.  You'll see four more Pamirs on the southwest edge.  Attacking 
these arouses the interest of several Cossacks that actually may pose a danger
if you're not careful.  Kill off as many Cossacks as you can, retreating as
necessary.
 Now turn your attention back to the army.  Send the Fang north to rendezvous
with the Mammoths.  After you get close they'll slave to the Fang and follow 
it.  Go north over the bridge, then west.  Before you cross a second bridge, 
destroy a handful of Pamirs to the northeast so they can't hit your flank.  
Waiting to the west are a few more Pamirs that make for easy killing.  Head
for the west border of the map and wait for the Mammoths to catch up.
 Now go south and skirt the ED base.  If you didn't kill off all the Cossacks
before they'll harass you now.  If the Mammoths didn't catch up before you 
went south they'll drive straight through the ED base and get killed by 
defensive emplacements.
 Once you pass the base you're in the clear.  Just follow the path your 
Meteors scouted earlier to the south base.  Remember that even though your
tanks can float over the water easily the Mammoths are stuck on the land 
route.  After they arrive you have to send the Fang home before you can end
the mission.

MISSION: You're back at the lab to test the Tenebre II, based on the Fang
vehicle.  This time you don't have to do anything at all, just watch the 
Tenebre run the tests.  After it destroys the first UCS drone robot it 
explodes - there's nothing you can do to prevent this.

ENEMIES: Enemy base on the center west map border with Cossacks and 105mm 
Pamirs.
MISSION: Here's a simple mission.  The briefing tells you that you already 
have the detonation codes for the ED base.  Just unload the Fang and send it
to the base at the other side of the map.  Fang is in no danger as long as you
don't sit still too long.  Park next to the Research Center until a message 
appears, then run away.  All the buildings except for a Power Plant and a 
Weapon Production Center in the southeast corner of the base will explode.
 This pisses all the ED units off and they make a beeline for your base.  The 
Fang can probably take out a Pamir in a single shot now.  Let the Meteors 
handle the Cossacks and mop up helpless Pamirs.  The rush is strong but it 
won't last.
 With all the forces destroyed set up Mines and Ore Transport Refineries as 
you see fit.  There won't be any more spending cash for a while, so be sure to
set some aside now.  Reload your Meteors before you leave.

ENEMIES: TENEBRE III and many, many 105mm Pamirs.
MISSION: Back to the lab again, but this time the test pilot has turned 
traitor and started attacking your base.  There are two ways to win this 
mission: the cheap way and the expensive way.  If you like quick victories
bring along 5k CR in the Jupiter.  When it arrives, don't empty the transport;
instead take the 5k CR and use it to upgrade the buildings in the base that 
are being attacked.  Putting up shields on the building that TENEBRE is 
actively attacking will slow it down a bit.  Add a Rocket Launcher to the 
nearby Aerial Supply Depot and you'll be able to destroy TENEBRE without 
risking any of your units.  Obviously this costs money, but it's the fastest
way to win the mission.
 If you don't like spending money you can win the mission with actual combat.
Unload the Jupiter and allow your buildings to self-destruct.  This destroys
the entire base and puts TENEBRE on the run for ED cover.  Send the Meteors 
south to destroy an ED TE in the corner.  With this gone there is no way the 
TENEBRE can escape.  Now just follow it all over the map.  It's hard to hit 
while it's moving, but it can't regenerate then either.  After it's down you 
can end the mission or choose to kill more of the Pamirs for experience.
 The other thing you should do in this mission is bring the Fang so it can 
collect the artifact right next to the LZ.  This will give it 3600 PSU shields
for free - in fact, it's one of only two ways to give the Fang shields, and 
you'll want those later when you face energy weapons.

ENEMIES: The enemy base is just east of map center, but he's provided with 
tanks all over the map and tower outposts on the west and east bridges.  Face
down Cossacks, 20mm and Rocket Siberias, and 105mm and Rocket Pamirs.
MISSION: This mission's quite simple.  The briefing tells you that all you 
need to do to stop the impending ED attack is sever the three bridges that 
lead to your island in the north.  These bridges end in the northeast corner,
just southeast of your base, and on the center west map border.  The clock at
the top of the map tells you how much longer until the ED show up.
 The first thing you should do as you wait for the transport is drop two more
Ore Transport Refineries on the large field you're already mining.  Also set 
up enough Supply Depots for your tanks and Guardian pairs at the two breaks in
the Laser Wall.  Rocket Launchers are the best weapons for all these 
structures since they won't have to worry about ground forces.
 Now for breaking bridges.  The central bridge is unguarded so start there; 
force-attack two adjacent squares so no one can cross it.  Mob the bridge with
Lunars and Moons since there are no defenses.  With the central bridge down 
head to the northeast corner.  Use your air force to fly past the Towers and
Pillboxes and destroy the Power Plants from behind; if you move quickly you 
won't take any damage.  Bring in the army after the Towers fall silent to take
out the bridge.  If they venture too far south you may attract the attention 
of a small group of Pamirs waiting on the next island.  After the bridge drops
pull your army back to the base.
 The most difficult bridge to break is the west one, but it's not too tough if
you're using the Meteors.  Fly over again and take out the Small Towers 
defending the Power Plants first so you can move with impunity.  During this 
time some tanks may flow across the bridge - let your army handle them without
coming into range of the Towers.  Disable defenses on both sides of the bridge
and let the army mop up.
 That's all you have to do for this mission.  If you're using extra OTRs the
field will probably mine out before the clock expires, but you can stay to get
the rest of the minerals.  The ED won't repair the broken bridges.  Eventually
you will see a flock of Cossacks heading your way but the Guardians should be
more than capable of handling these.  Wait for the field to empty and shut 
down.  Again, make sure your Meteors are at full ammo before you leave.

OBJECTIVES: -Meet up with the convoy at the first base
   -Escort the convoy to the southern base.  100% must survive.
   -FANG must return to main base
TRANSPORT: Fang x1, Meteor x4, <Moon> x5
RESEARCH: Regenerator m1, Regenerator m2, Regenerator m3
ENEMIES: Scattered Rocket and 105mm Pamirs, Rocket and Laser Siberias, and a 
couple of Laser Volgas.
MISSION: The UCS needs another escort.  Drop the Meteors and Fang with 
whatever escort you desire next to the Mammoth and three Harvesters.  You also
have an important choice: to forge an alliance with either the UCS or ED.  
Soon after the Fang and convoy start moving you'll receive a message from Neo,
who you should be familiar with if you've played the ED and UCS campaigns 
already.  He and your general have a past from 2140, and in honor of that 
he'll give you the option to ally with the ED if you destroy the convoy.  If
you choose this route, just blow the helpless civilian vehicles and go home.
Skip to Rio de Janeiro (ED) on the walkthrough.  
 If, on the other hand, you want to work with the UCS, you'll have to play out
the mission as is.  You'll be facing ED energy Lasers this time, so if you 
don't have shields on your units you'll discover exactly why you should.  
Alternately, this is a great time to burn through the Lunars you've been 
carefully preserving so you can replace them with Moons.  Fortunately, the 
Meteors can take out the Lasers from the air with no damage; unfortunately 
this will take careful management since the Lasers are guarded by Rockets.
 First things first: your path this time is less direct.  You will travel 
south from the LZ to an east-west island, then northwest along bridges to the
north map border, then straight south across the main water body over bridges
and small islands, then southeast to the UCS base.  The Lasers are located on
the small island you cross in the middle of the water (southwest of the west
end of the first turn) and north of the UCS base.  Take out the small island 
with your Meteors first since it has Heavy Laser Volgas guarded only by a 
couple of Rocket Siberias.  Note that the Volgas can freely move out over 
water if distressed.
 After this detachment goes down send the Meteors southeast to the plain north
of the southern UCS base.  Try to kill the Laser Siberias here without taking 
too much damage from the Rocket Pamir guardians.  Backtrack north along the 
bridges and clear out as many 105mm Pamirs as possible.  If your Meteors are 
experienced enough they should be able to clear all the tanks in the level 
without running out of ammo.
 Now get the convoy rolling.  You should have no trouble getting the convoy in
as long as you're careful to make sure the path is clear.  Congratulate 
yourself and move on to Madagascar.

NOTE: You only get Madagascar if you successfully escorted the UCS convoy in
Great Lakes.  If you destroyed the convoy go to Rio de Janeiro (ED).

ENEMIES: Large enemy base on the northeast corner of the map with Cossacks, 
Laser and 20mm Siberias, and 105mm and Rocket Pamirs.  Lots of Rocket 
Launchers mounted on base defenses.
MISSION: If you've played the UCS campaign you already know their side of this
mission.  The UCS will still provide a steady flow of units against the ED in
the north.  That won't be enough to take the base, but it will distract the ED
for a while.
 As for yourself, the base defenses are more than enough to repel pretty much
all the ED attacks.  Your task is to use the Meteors to tear down the base
itself.  Start from the west where the mineral field is.  It's a challenge, 
but possible, to kill the Mines quickly and prevent them from being rebuilt.
The challenge bit is that you'll be harassed by Cossacks and may have to 
retreat frequently to keep the Meteors alive.  Also, the Rocket Launchers on 
the Small Towers have longer range than your 20mms, which is cause for further
caution.  The longer it takes you to pull this off, the more resources the ED
get to use against you.  
 The surprise for this mission is Neo's appearance.  He converts all of the 
UCS units to ED control.  As a courtesy, he'll keep the majority of these 
fighting the UCS in the south rather than attacking you directly.  This will
disrupt the UCS attacks on the ED.  Stay here long enough and he'll do it 
again.
 After the UCS base empties its mineral field the Harvesters will start 
heading for yours.  You can destroy them with no repercussions to the alliance
but doing so prevents the UCS from building more units to attack the ED with.
 When the resource-gathering facilities drop and the Cossacks stop flowing you
are in perfect position to gut and dismember the base.  Take it slow and
retreat when you need to repair.

ENEMIES: Enemy base on the south border of the map.  Lots of Rocket Towers and
structures, plus Cossacks, Laser and Ion Caspians and Siberias, and the usual
105mm and Rocket Pamirs.
MISSION: Again, this is a retread of the UCS campaign version of this mission.
The UCS has the west border, you have the east border, and you'll meet in the 
south to crush the ED.
 This time you'll have to watch out for Ion Cannons.  It's an energy weapon so
your shielded tanks will be safe, and the ED won't be using Repairers to take
over your units, but they will shut down unshielded tanks and structures 
fairly quickly.  Lasers will be upgraded to 2x Lasers and are therefore more
dangerous.  And rocket emplacements will still be outshooting your 20mm 
Meteors.  Other than that it's a very standard mission.
 Drop your base just southwest of the LZ around the mineral field.  Set up 
defenses facing west.  The biggest threat to your base will be the UCS when
Neo switches them to ED control again.  Twice.  Even so, the UCS base itself
will knock down most of the converts with structure defenses.
 Attack the ED from the east border of the map to cut around the towers.  Lure
out the Cossacks and Rocket Pamirs before you enter.  Take out the Power 
Plants from behind to deactivate structure defenses and just crawl through.  
The UCS will help tear the base apart as defenses drop.

OBJECTIVES: -Destroy ED base
   -Destroy Neo's base
TRANSPORT: Meteor x4, <Moon> x6
RESEARCH: Guided Heavy Rocket 50%
ENEMIES: One large base at the north end of the map with Cossacks, 105mm 
Pamirs, Laser Siberias and Caspians, and introducing the 120mm Kruszchev.
MISSIONS: Neo's stunt in Australia was too much and now the UCS orders you to 
take him down as a show of support for the alliance.  Pretty sad, considering 
how friendly he was to you this time around (as opposed to the UCS campaign).
 Unlike previous missions, I can't do this one with just the air force - they
can't deal enough damage and are too fragile for sustained attacks.  So 
starting here I built up a group of 5 Rocket Moons and 5 Electro Craters.  
3600 PSU shields are a given.
 As for your base, enemies will be approaching from over the northwest plateau
(Cossacks), down the east pass (tanks), and, surprisingly, up the cliff 
overlooking your power structures to the south (more tanks).  I don't know how
they get up there, but toss a couple of Guardians there to drive them off.  
Beyond the mineral fields in your base and the ED base there are four more on 
this map: in order of proximity they are southeast, southwest, northeast, and 
northwest of your base.  Over the course of the mission the ED will take over 
the two northern ones unless you check on them occasionally and scrape the 
Mines off.
 The first thing you should do after you land is take out the ED Small Towers 
and TEs in the cul-de-sac north of your base.  With these down the ED has to
approach overland, which gives you more warning.  Also take out the other end
of the tunnels at the north end of the east pass.
 There's no easy way to destroy the main ED base with the Meteors.  Approach 
from the east and you're facing Small Towers with rockets plus Cossacks.  Try
the west and find more Rocket Towers and the occasional Rocket Kruszchev, 
which are much too tough for the Meteors to take out easily.  The mineral 
field is on the north side right against the border and therefore is quite 
difficult to reach and destroy before also taking out most of the base and its
defenders.  Neo's Headquarters is on the west side of the base but it's well-
defended; you can take it out with the Meteors but you have to destroy the 
rest of the base anyway.  Even destroying the power infrastructure is very 
difficult because of the prevalence of armed buildings and Cossacks that will 
force you to retreat.
 I suggest moving quickly as soon as you create an attacking force of Moons 
and Craters.  Sweep in from the east so you can retreat if necessary and cover
them with the Meteors to swat down Cossacks.  Electro Cannons are excellent 
for tearing apart buildings, but as soon as you start firing the ED will 
upgrade the building in question with shields that slow you down.  Retreat as
necessary to the cover of Regenerator and Recharger Phoboses and keep pounding
until it falls apart.  If the mission doesn't end after you destroy the 
northern base check the mineral fields northeast and northwest of your base
for Mines.  And of course destroying Neo's HQ doesn't actually kill him.

ENEMIES: 20mm, Rocket, and Plasma Tigers, Laser Siberias, 120mm Kruzchevs,

MISSION: Neo's alive in Brazil.  The UCS managed to destroy all LZs in the 
area, so he can't run anymore.  In turn he captured all the UCS units and is 
now destroying the UCS base, so it's up to you to take him out.
 If you haven't been using Sonic and Electro Cannons before now it's time to
start building them.  None of your enemies on this level have shields so these
weapons will cut to the bone.  You don't need more than a single Jupiter-load
of tanks.
 Let the captured UCS tanks burn through their ammo on the UCS structures 
before you approach.  The Lunars you're provided with will probably get 
themselves killed in short order so you don't have to worry about them at all.
Sweep in with Electros and Sonics to clear the base.  
 Now go straight south.  You'll pass a V-shaped peninsula, then cross a large 
bay.  Neo is with a group of tanks on the other side.  He's in a modified 
Caspian that's actually quite speedy and difficult to herd with only the 
Craters.  Use Meteors to keep track of him and take him out instead of chasing
him all over the map.  After he dies you can end the mission or clear the rest
of the map for experience.

ENEMIES: The ED has a base in the northeast corner with lots of Rocket 
Launchers and Lasers defending the structures.  The UCS is in the northwest
corner and fields Plasma and 20mm Tigers, 20mm Gargoyles, Rocket Panthers, and
a steady stream of Harvesters.
MISSION: Just from reading the breakdown you already know this is the mission 
where your alliance with the UCS ends.  You also get access to several 
technologies, the most important of which is the Thunderer bomber.  You won't 
need it this time but it will be very useful in the future.
 You'll start with a handful of Rocket Craters and two adjacent LZs.  I don't 
know why there are two, but there they are.  The Rocket Craters will 
immediately start hammering on a Pillbox guarding the nearby mineral field.  
Pull them back and set them to defending to the east, where the ED will flow
from.  If you let them attack freely they will run out of ammo quickly and 
can't be resupplied until you destroy the three Pillboxes and Power Plant and
start building your base.  Bring in the Electro and Sonic Cannons to do that
job.
 After the initial ED attack is repulsed the UCS will start making its way 
across the central pass to attack the ED.  Along the way they'll destroy an ED
TE.  It is possible to go underground in this mission by using this TE, but
it's extremely dangerous since the LC can't build TEs and the only other one 
is within the ED base itself.  I don't know what's down there.  Anyway, the 
UCS tanks will push the ED back and secure your base for you, then keep going.
 Meanwhile focus on setting up your base.  Put a couple of Defenders on the 
west side of the mineral field and at your end of the central pass.  As long 
as the UCS are your friends they'll walk past unmolested.  Don't worry about
the eastern front.
 Bust out your carryover Craters and Meteors to help the UCS dismantle the ED
base.  If you keep your distance the structure defenses won't bother you much.
I don't recommend using the provided Rocket Craters because they don't have 
shields so the Lasers pose a significant danger to them.  Follow the UCS and
watch them demolish the base.  When you get a chance clear the mineral field
and drop OTRs or Mines on top of it with a couple of Defenders for protection.
 When it becomes clear that the ED base is doomed the UCS will send you a 
message claiming all of the minerals in the region for themselves.  This 
pisses off your LC superiors, who now order you to take out the UCS as well.
The UCS units that attacked the ED will flow back through your base but these
damaged Tigers and Spiders won't hold a candle to your Craters and Meteors.  
The UCS will also start sending Harvesters in to siphon your mineral field.  
Block the central pass with a Laser Wall so you can focus on the east pass.
 With the threat localized use your Meteors to head north to scout the UCS.
The Power Plant is on the south side and makes an easy target, but between the
Gargoyles and its own high HP you won't be able to take it down particularly
quickly.  As it's going down the UCS will build another one on the north side
of the base.  Use your ground forces to feint and draw attention to the 
mountain ramp so your Meteors can blitz over and take this one out as well.
Mop up.  After you finish this mission skip down to Peru.

NOTE: You skip to this mission from Great Lakes if you destroy the UCS convoy
instead of escorting it, thereby creating an alliance with the ED instead of
the UCS.  Neo receives you wholeheartedly.
OBJECTIVES: -Escort Neo to the UCS base
   -Destroy all UCS structures
   -FANG must return to main base
TRANSPORT: Fang x1, <Moon> x9
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: A UCS base south of your LZ with Grenade and Plasma Tigers and lots
of defensive emplacements.
MISSION: This one's just fun.  Neo offers to "deal with" the local UCS base if
the Fang will escort him in.  Just show up and move Fang close enough to slave
Neo to him, then run south.  For some reason Neo likes to get stuck on the 
laser wall, so turn it off if he jams there.  
 Head south along the shore until you see a small inland body of water 
separated from the ocean by a short northwest-southeast strip of land.  Wait
here for Neo to catch up.  Save.  Once he's with you dash west into the UCS 
base and hide next to the Power Plant on the far side.  Start attacking it.  
The UCS units will all follow you and won't pose a danger to Neo.  Keep moving
if your HP drops past 25%.
 When Neo reaches the UCS base all the UCS units convert to your control, but 
the structures and attached weapons will keep firing against you.  You must 
protect Neo; if he dies you lose the mission and a major opportunity.  As soon
as the units convert hit <NumLock> to pause and select all these units to 
give them new targets.  If you don't do this they will keep firing on Neo and
Fang by virtue of inertia.  It is very important to take out the Power Plant 
first so that the defensive emplacements stop shooting.  You still have to 
take out the Small Towers but that should be no challenge.  After you destroy
the base kill two more towers on the peak just to the north, then four more
northwest of those, then four more north of those surrounded by walls.  Take
all your new units and head for the LZ.  Leave the Harvesters since there's 
absolutely no way you can use them except as damage magnets.
 If you like you can choose to wait a long time before bringing Neo down, 
increasing your unit reward but also making it more dangerous for both Fang 
and Neo because they'll take more damage while they're invading.  It takes 
about 26 game hours for the UCS to drain the mineral field and maximize their 
units for you.  Also don't miss the handful of Plasma Spiders on the east 
peninsula and the Plasma Spiders and Panthers to the extreme south.  The south
troops are trapped by jungle but you can force-fire to destroy this.  If you 
didn't get enough troops from the UCS base you can use these to destroy it.
 There are some extremely useful things in the units you just captured.  The 
combat units are obvious, but you have to Change Script to a battle unit.  The
Condors work just like your Mercuries.  The Repairers are much faster than 
waiting for regeneration and can upgrade and add shields to your existing 
units - for a price.  Using Repairers is the other way to give the Fang 
shields (the first way was using the artifact in ACME-Lab 3).  The Mammoths 
can be used to make cheap walls instead of the laser version as well as 
trenches.  If you take captured units into combat note that you cannot reload
Grenade Tigers because your Supply Depots don't make grenades.  You also 
cannot upgrade UCS units with the Repairer because you don't have the right
technology.

ENEMIES: Scattered small bases with 105mm emplacements, plus one corridor 
northwest of your base guarded by 20mm Small Towers.  Each of these bases has
a group of either 120mm Trucks, 105mm Tanks, or Rocket Heavy Tanks.
MISSION: It's another resource grab.  Immediately head for the mineral field
northeast of your base and drop two OTRs on top; the third miner can be either
a Mine to provide funds for defense of another OTR for quick extraction.  Also
set up power and supply facilities and at least one Guardian to the east.  
Keep the Jupiter moving bringing in combat units.
 The enemies for this mission are just local tribes that happen to be using 
castoff ED equipment.  The good news is that they will fight each other just 
as readily as they fight you.  The bad news is that they start the mission 
with groups all over the map just waiting for their cue to storm your base.
The small bases are scattered and very small, usually just a Supply Depot with
a Boyar, sometimes Research Centers, sometimes Headquarters, plus Power Plants
and lots of 105mm defenses.  Luckily there are very few antiair defenses.  
Also, none of these enemies have shields, so the Electro Cannon and any Plasma
weapons you liberated last mission will be very useful.
 As soon as they arrive group your air force and send them south.  Find and 
destroy as many of the Trucks as you can before they start rolling to attack
your base.  They have no antiair ability so this shouldn't be difficult.  
After the Trucks die go northeast to a group of Tanks and kill those off the 
same way.  Don't bother destroying the bases since they're completely helpless
against you.
 Now go northeast to some more Tanks.  Kill as many as you can, but some will
almost inevitably start moving toward your base.  Chasing them forces your 
aircraft down a passage guarded by 20mm Small Towers.  More importantly, as 
they move south they meet a group of Rocket Heavy Tanks that have migrated 
from the northeast part of the map.  Both groups start shooting and might kill
a few of each other off for you as they head south to your base.  
 Your ground forces still have to stop the combined offensive on the north 
edge of your base.  It will be bloody, but you can let all the Lunars and 20mm
and Grenade Tigers die since they'll soon become useless without shields.  
Plasma Tigers, Spiders, and Panthers are more useful because of their higher
damage, but they will also fall eventually.  The only old units you need to 
preserve from this mission are the support units, the aircraft, and the Fang.
 After this there will be another attack from the east.  This base is located
at the tip of the landmass and has Trucks, Tanks, and Heavy Tanks together.  
You shouldn't have any trouble as long as you keep all your firepower together
and don't let the Rocket Launchers focus on your aircraft.  After this allow 
your military to destroy the abandoned small bases for experience.  Keep 
mining until you hit the threshold; drain more if you feel comfortable.

Small Towers that you can kill for fun.  On the west side, head south all the 
way to the base and draw Neo into position next to the WPC.  Bring the air 
force to the southwest corner so that the Fang can retreat if the UCS 
Gargoyles start hammering it too hard.  Neo will blow most of the structures
and head home.
 You still have a few more buildings to mop up.  The southeast side of the 
main base has a surviving but unpowered Fortress.  Keep going east to the 
shore to take out two Power Plants, a Teleport, and several towers plus some
straggling Tigers.
 Now cut back to the main base and head north.  Wipe out any Small Towers you
see either in the blockaded area or the pass east of it.  Farther north you'll
find the last Power Plant and Teleport.  Take out the Small Towers at the 
bridges if you didn't already and you should clear the objective.  Send the 
Fang home for mission complete.

ENEMIES: Large UCS base at map center with lots of 20mm and Plasma Towers and
even Fortresses plus Rocket Tigers and Panthers and 20mm Gargoyles.
MISSION: Here's an easy one.  The UCS have built a Plasma Cannon artillery 
that Neo can capture and use to destroy the base in this area.  Send the Fang
all the way to the revealed map location to the south and wait next to the 
PCC.  You'll pass a few turrets but the shouldn't be able to deal appreciable
damage as you zip by.  Neo will take over the PCC briefly, but security 
backups will destroy it before you can put it to use.
 You still have to destroy the UCS base.  Send Fang back and fly east from the
LZ to a small mineral field. Set up two Defenders facing west to guard the
approach.  The level is set up so that the only way from the UCS base is 
through a central pass.  Shortly after you arrive, before the Jupiter can 
finish its second trip from the main base, a UCS attack will destroy the LZ.
It's too strong to stop with your existing forces, so just build another LZ to
the east.
 After you've brought in more troops you can send the air force south over the
mountains.  The UCS base is vulnerable from the east, with Power Plants 
supporting defenses on the south, center, west, and far west.  First attack 
the east side and destroy all the Gargoyles and Repairers that appear, then go
for the Small Towers and Power Plants.  Use ground forces to wipe the base off
the map.  If the mission doesn't end yet check the west side for a defensive 
outpost and the south approach to the PCC wreckage for Small Towers.  Make 
sure your air units are fully loaded before you leave.
 There are two other mineral fields on this map that you can mine on equator 
to the west and east.  Drop OTRs or Mines as necessary.  For some reason the 
UCS rarely bothers these - they send most of their Harvesters toward your 
field.  
 You also get access to a lot of useful research, especially Thunderers and 
Air Sonic Cannons.  Pick out what you like; you'll end the mission long before
you research all the advances.  Sonic Thunderers are excellent for destroying 
helpless structures.

      21. Lesotho (ED)
OBJECTIVES: -Destroy UCS forces
   -Destroy ED forces (traitors)
TRANSPORT: Meteor/Gargoyle x10
RESEARCH: Heavy Electro Cannon, 2x Heavy Electro Cannon
   Plasma Cannon
ENEMIES: UCS base to the west with 20mm Gargoyles and Plasma and Rocket 
Panthers.  ED base to the east with Laser Caspians, 120mm Kruszchevs, Rocket
Pamirs, and Cossacks.
MISSION: Just like the UCS-ally version, only slightly more dangerous because
of Plasma Cannons.  You start with 5 Rocket Craters, but they'll all die 
trying to kill three Plasma Panthers.  Don't build a base yet.  Offload your
air force and head for the UCS base.  Destroy Power Plants on the south and 
north sides to render them helpless, then head to the ED base and destroy as
much of their mining operation as possible.  
 Wait until the ED forces move past your base and head for the UCS before you
start building a base.  If you go early UCS tanks will attack and tear it up
in the infancy.  After the ED cripples the UCS base they'll demand that the LC
surrender the region, but your superiors order you to keep mining.  
 With the ED base short on minerals they shouldn't be much of a challenge.  If
you're still holding on to any Lunars or 20mm anything this is the mission to
let them get killed and replace them with shielded Craters and Crushers.  
Neither base is particularly offensive so just dismember them and mine out.  
The UCS rarely finishes off their field, but the ED may make a play for it.

      22. Peru
NOTE: The mission tree branches converge again here.  Whether you allied with
the UCS or the ED you will reach this mission after the alliance breaks up in
Lesotho.
OBJECTIVES: -Provide the base with 100,000 CR
TRANSPORT: Meteor x4, Regenerator x1, Recharger x1, Mercury x4
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: ED base in the east defended with way too many rockets and sending
Screamer Caspians, 120mm and Laser Kruszchevs, and a handful of Cossacks.  UCS
base in the northwest with Rocket and Plasma Panthers, Spiders, and Tigers, 
and 20mm Gargoyles.
MISSION: It's time to shift into high resource-gathering gear.  This mission 
is your first opportunity to finish the game if you've been diligent in using
OTRs.
 Your first base has about 60k minerals, but that's not enough.  After the 
Jupiter offloads use the Meteors to secure a large field due north from the 
provided Main Base.  The Solar Power Plant and Battery you start with can 
easily be destroyed by troops approaching your base, so build new ones next to
the field.  Drop two OTRs on this field and four more on the large north one 
to speed extraction.  Also set up a Guardian in your base and at least three 
on the north edge of the larger field.  I encourage upgrading at least one of 
each of the hardpoints with energy weapons since the close quarters can cause
the rockets to hit your own buildings more often than the enemy.
 Once you've secured the resources you're good to go.  It's not worth 
attacking either of the enemy bases because they're too well defended and the 
other base will attack you while the troops are away.  The UCS will keep 
trying to tap the larger field with Harvesters but the Guardians will have no
trouble.  Every once in a while you'll see some ground troops for target 
practice.  The ED will send some Screamers your way, but if you've set up your
defenses properly they won't bother you at all.  If you're in a good position 
when you hit 100k overmine for bonus minerals.

      23. Amazon
OBJECTIVES: -Provide base with 100,000 CR
TRANSPORT: Meteor x4, Regenerator x1, Recharger x1, Mercury x2, Crater x2
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: UCS attacking with 20mm Gargoyles, Rocket and Plasma Tigers and 
Panthers.  ED attacking with Cossacks, 120mm Kruszchevs and Urals, and Laser
Siberias and Caspians.
MISSION: Again the mission is focused on resource collection.  If you need 
more than 200k CR to finish the spaceship (check at the Space Port) try to 
secure more than half this mission.  By this time I assume that if you allied
with the ED all the stolen UCS units from Rio de Janeiro are dead.  All your 
other ground units should have maximum possible shields.
 Your base has a small mineral field that should be dedicated to two OTRs 
immediately.  Substitute one Mine if you're extremely short on cash and can't
provide more from the main base.  Fly south from your base to find another 
large mineral field at the center of the map.  Drop three OTRs here and let 
your air force defend it.  As long as they stay over the field and don't stray
to the pass to the west the only thing they have to worry about is encroaching
UCS Harvesters.  Later they may see a few Rocket Panthers that will make for 
difficult takedowns.
 Your main base will see Cossacks from the southwest over the power 
structures, Gargoyles from the northeast, and tanks of all sorts flowing past
the cliff to the north.  These tanks will have a clear shot on the mining 
facilities so you must move your ground forces down to defend them.  The 
provided Crushers have Heavy Electro Cannons that can be combined with Electro
Craters for maximum effect since many of the lighter enemy tanks don't have 
shields.
 Stay within your bases, keep mining as quickly as possible and don't stop 
until you hit the campaign objective or enemy attacks force you to retreat 
from the central field.  Keep your defenses up and you should have no trouble.

      24. Andes
OBJECTIVES: -Provide your base with 100,000 CR
TRANSPORT: Meteor x4, Fang x1, Crater x5
RESEARCH: no new advances
ENEMIES: UCS base in the southwest corner with 20mm Gargoyles, Rocket and 
Plasma Panthers, and Rocket, Plasma, and 20mm Tigers.  ED base to the 
southeast with Cossacks, Laser and 120mm Urals, Ion Siberias, and Laser and
Rocket Kruszchevs.
MISSION: This is the last LC mission; if you don't get enough credits to 
satisfy the space program here you lose the game.  Pull out all the stops and 
donate any spare credits to the Space Port to accelerate the process.  Dump
all your units in the mission area as soon as possible.
 There's a small field in your base that you can drop two OTRs on, but the 
real mother lode is at map center (again).  Fly there with the LCAF and drop
7-10 OTRs to pull out the minerals as quickly as possible.  For most of the 
mission the UCS and ED will ignore this outpost, but later it will become a
target.  Don't bother with defenses.
 Shortly after you arrive the UCS will send a small detachment of Tigers in.
The Lunars the mission provides you with aren't nearly enough for defense, so 
bring in the Craters and Crushers as quickly as possible.  Use the mission 
Main Base to build more if absolutely necessary, but no more than you need to
defend yourself. 
 After this initial attack, most of the pain will come from the ED arriving 
through the east Laser Walls.  Stop them with focused firepower but don't 
sweat light losses like the Lunars and Moons.  Every once in a while you'll
see a Cossack, but some of these will be intercepted by the central field OTRs
and the LCAF guarding them.  There will be one Cossack blitz, after that they
come and die alone.
 Eventually the UCS will get their act together and start sending more forces 
at you.  This is just a distraction so their Harvesters can get a piece of the
central field.  This also signals that the ED will begin attacking the central
field in earnest soon, so relocate tanks if necessary.
 When the ED finally show up they'll use heavy tanks to tear apart the OTRs 
quickly.  Your Meteors can down Urals easily enough, but the stronger armor 
and higher HP on Kruszchevs makes them a job for energy weapons.  Also watch
out for a Gruz that builds Power Plants and Pillboxes that can become 
problematic.  The ED will try to distract you with Cossacks, but destroy Urals
first to help protect your mining operation.  Don't take tanks south of the 
field because ED Minelayers are busy making a no-man's-land of the passage.
When you have enough credits for the Space Port (not the mission objective) 
you automatically win the game.
